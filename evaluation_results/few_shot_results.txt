Question: do you have an 819 flight from DENVER to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find if there is a flight number 819 from Denver to San Francisco, you can construct the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '819';
```

This query checks for the flight with number 819 departing from Denver (identified through the city and airport services) and arriving at San Francisco.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from KANSAS CITY to ST. PAUL that are departing at 16:00 (4:00 PM), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '16:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table where the source airport is KANSAS CITY and the destination airport is ST. PAUL.
- It checks that the departure time matches exactly with 16:00.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to correlate city names with their airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights leaving Boston at 6:45 AM and going to Washington, you would use a SQL query that selects the relevant flight information based on the given criteria. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '06:45:00';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This specifies that you want the unique flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **FROM**: This specifies the tables involved: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`.
- **WHERE**: This filters the results based on conditions:
  - It checks if the city codes match for Boston and Washington.
  - It compares the `FROM_AIRPORT` in `FLIGHT` with the airport code of Boston and the `TO_AIRPORT` with the airport code of Washington.
  - It checks if the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is exactly 6:45 AM.

Make sure to adjust for the time format and data type being used in your database in case it's different.

Question: i need a flight from PITTSBURGH to NEW YORK leaving at 1700
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Pittsburgh to New York that leave at 1700, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '1700';
```

### Explanation:
- Selecting distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table where the `FROM_AIRPORT` corresponds to Pittsburgh and the `TO_AIRPORT` corresponds to New York.
- The query also checks that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is equal to '1700' (5:00 PM).
- It joins the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to find the corresponding airport codes for both cities.

Question: is there a 400 o'clock flight from WASHINGTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find if there is a flight from WASHINGTON to DENVER at a specific time, such as 4:00 o'clock, you would need to write a SQL query that checks for flights between these two locations that depart at that specific time. The following SQL query can be used to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '04:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **FROM Clauses**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to filter the relevant flights.
2. **WHERE Conditions**: It checks:
   - If the origin city is "WASHINGTON".
   - If the destination city is "DENVER".
   - The departure time is `04:00:00` (in HH:MM:SS format).
3. **SELECT DISTINCT**: This ensures that if there are multiple entries for the same flight, only unique flight IDs are returned.

Ensure you modify your time format correctly based on your database's requirements (some may use 24-hour format while others may store it in different datatypes).

Question: are there any 400 o'clock flights from WASHINGTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check for any flights departing from WASHINGTON to DENVER at 4:00 PM (or 16:00 in 24-hour format), you can construct a SQL query similar to the previous queries. 

Here’s how you can formulate the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '16:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to ensure that the flights are between WASHINGTON and DENVER.
- It specifically filters for flights departing at 4:00 PM using the condition `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '16:00:00'`. 

Make sure the time format (like '16:00:00') matches the format in your database. Adjust it if necessary based on your database design or data type for the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

Raw LLM Response:
To get a flight between Boston and Atlanta on any day at one in the afternoon, you can use a SQL query that selects flights based on the specified conditions. Here's the SQL statement to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0

      FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
ORDER BY FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: To find services available at Baltimore and Pittsburgh.
   - **CITY**: To filter city names and their corresponding codes.
   - **FLIGHT**: To get the flight details for outbound and return trips.
   - **FLIGHT_FARE** and **FARE**: To link the flights to their fare information.

2. **Query Conditions**:
   - The cities are filtered by name.
   - Flights are derived based on the departure and arrival airports between Baltimore and Pittsburgh.
   - Matching flight fares for both outbound and return flights are included.

3. **Distinct Flights & Costs**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures unique flight entries, and the `ORDER BY` clause helps sort them by the cost of the round trip.

4. **Assumptions Made**:
   - The query assumes that the flight from Baltimore to Pittsburgh and the return flight from Pittsburgh to Baltimore is tied by the same fare; if you have specific fare conditions or other requirements (e.g., timing), these can be adjusted accordingly.

### Usage:
Run this SQL query in a suitable SQL environment connected to your database to get the round trip flight arrangements based on the specified conditions. Adjust variables or parameters as needed for the specific dates or times if required.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from Burbank to Tacoma, the SQL query would involve joining the relevant tables to find flights where Burbank is the departure airport and Tacoma is the arrival airport while ensuring that the flights are round trip in terms of having matching return flights available.

Here's how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table (`FLIGHTalias0`).
- We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the correct airport codes for Burbank and Tacoma.
- The `FARE` table is included to check for round trip requirements. In this example, I assumed that there's a column `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` set to 'Y' to indicate round trip flights.
- The query ensures that we're looking for flights departing from Burbank to Tacoma and ensures that these trips are round trip based on the fare rules. 

Make sure to adapt the column names such as `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` to the correct ones as per your actual database schema if they differ!

Raw LLM Response:
To get all the round-trip flights from New York to Miami, you can use the following SQL query. This will join the necessary tables and filter for round-trip flights between the two specified cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE ( 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK' 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
) 
AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Select Distinct Flight IDs**: We start by selecting distinct flight IDs to avoid duplicates.
  
2. **Table Joins**: We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both departure (New York) and arrival (Miami) airports, and we also join the `CITY` table to confirm the city names.

3. **Flight Criteria**: We filter for flights that depart from New York and arrive in Miami.

4. **Round Trip Requirement**: We check that the flight is marked as a round trip by looking at the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field in the `FARE` table.

5. **Flight Fare Association**: We ensure that we get only those flights that have corresponding fare details by properly joining the `FLIGHT_FARE`.

This query effectively retrieves all round-trip flights from New York to Miami.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH, you would typically need to identify flights that operate in both directions (from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH and returning from PITTSBURGH to DALLAS) and check the fare details for round trips. Below is an SQL query that captures this logic:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AS Outbound_Flight, 
                FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID AS Return_Flight,
                FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to find the respective airports for the cities "DALLAS" and "PITTSBURGH".
- The `FLIGHT` table is queried to find outgoing flights from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH (`FLIGHTalias0`) and return flights from PITTSBURGH to DALLAS (`FLIGHTalias1`).
- We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` table with the `FARE` table to ensure we get the round trip cost tied to the correct fares.
- The final result contains distinct flight IDs for the outbound and return flights along with their round trip cost.

Make sure to define any specific date, time, or other filters as needed for your application's requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of all round trip flights from Orlando to Kansas City, you would need to join the appropriate tables to gather the required flight information based on the origin and destination airports. Here’s an SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "Y" 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation
1. **Airport Services**: The query uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to filter for the specific airports in Orlando and Kansas City.
2. **City**: The `CITY` table is used to link the airport service records to the respective city names.
3. **Flight Information**: The `FLIGHT` table is used to find the flights departing from Orlando to Kansas City.
4. **Round Trip Constraint**: It checks that the fare policy (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`) is applicable for round trips.

Make sure to adjust the WHERE clause to appropriately handle any specific requirements or nuances regarding how round trips are defined if your schema has any additional restrictions.

Raw LLM Response:
To create a SQL query for a round trip between WASHINGTON and SAN FRANCISCO, we need to find the flights departing from WASHINGTON to SAN FRANCISCO, as well as the flights returning from SAN FRANCISCO to WASHINGTON. Below is the SQL query that would accomplish this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_ID, 
                FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias1 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Aliasing**: We alias the tables to make the SQL statement more readable.
2. **City Matching**: We check for the cities involved (WASHINGTON and SAN FRANCISCO).
3. **Flight Matching**: We select flights from WASHINGTON to SAN FRANCISCO and then flights returning from SAN FRANCISCO to WASHINGTON.
4. **Fare Information**: We join with `FLIGHT_FARE` to ensure we are using valid fare data.
5. **Distinct Results**: We will output distinct flight IDs for both outbound and return trips.

This query provides a round trip flight option between WASHINGTON and SAN FRANCISCO. Depending on requirements, additional columns for flight details, costs, and class types may be added as needed.

```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects distinct flight IDs and their corresponding round trip costs.
2. It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to locate the specific airports for Indianapolis and Kansas City.
3. It checks that the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT` table correspond to those airports.
4. The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that we are retrieving only fares that are applicable for round trips.
5. The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is linked to include fare details associated with the flights.

Make sure to replace `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` condition if there's any specific value other than 'Y' that marks a flight as a round trip. Adjust any other conditions as needed based on your database structure and fare designation.

Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip tickets from CHARLOTTE to MONTREAL, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Flights:** The query retrieves distinct flight IDs for flights.
2. **Joining Tables:** It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT` to get relevant information about flights between CHARLOTTE and MONTREAL.
3. **City Conditions:** It ensures the departure city is CHARLOTTE and the arrival city is MONTREAL.
4. **Round Trip Requirement:** The query checks that the fare is marked for round trips by ensuring `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'Y'. 

This should provide the necessary results for round trip flights from CHARLOTTE to MONTREAL.

Question: round trip flights between NEW YORK and MIAMI

Raw LLM Response:
To find round-trip flights between New York and Miami, your SQL query could resemble the following. This would typically involve joining the relevant tables to find flights that meet the criteria of departing from New York to Miami and then returning from Miami to New York.

Here's a possible SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID <> FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find airport codes for New York and Miami.
   - `CITY` to ensure you are getting the right cities.
   - `FLIGHT` for selecting flights from New York to Miami and back.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Ensure that we have flights departing from New York (`FROM_AIRPORT`) to Miami (`TO_AIRPORT`) and a separate flight returning from Miami to New York.
   - The condition `FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID <> FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID` ensures that the flights are distinct.

3. **Round Trip**: The logic captures both legs of the trip (to and from).

Make sure you have the correct city names and any relevant parameters (such as travel dates) if required—these aren't included in the provided query.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BALTIMORE to PITTSBURGH, we'll need to gather information on flights from Baltimore to Pittsburgh and then the corresponding return flights. Below is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Join relevant tables, such as `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE`, to find the appropriate flights.
2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filter for flights leaving from Baltimore.
   - Specify the destination as Pittsburgh.
   - Ensure that the fare is valid for round-trip travel.
3. **Selection of Distinct Flights**: Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure you only get unique flight IDs.

You can adjust additional conditions (like date, time, etc.) as necessary to refine the search further.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH, you would need to query the relevant tables including AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FARE, FLIGHT, and FLIGHT_FARE. The SQL query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 1;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Tables Used**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to retrieve airport codes for BOSTON and PITTSBURGH.
   - `CITY` to ensure we're referring to the correct cities.
   - `FARE` to check the cost of the fares.
   - `FLIGHT` to find the flights available for the round trip.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` to link flights with their fares.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query checks that the flight is leaving from BOSTON and going to PITTSBURGH.
   - It ensures the round trip is possible by confirming `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is set to 1 (indicating that it's a round trip).

3. **Selection**: 
   - The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to avoid duplicate flight entries in the result.
   - Selected fields include the `FLIGHT_ID` and the `ROUND_TRIP_COST` to display relevant information regarding the fare for the round trip. 

Make sure to replace any variables (`day_number0`, `month_number0`, `year0`) with actual values or use a subquery to handle specific date querying if needed for scheduling.

In this query:
- We pull the distinct `FLIGHT_ID`s for flights originating from Boston and terminating in Washington.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to ensure we have the necessary information about the flights and their fares.
- The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that only round trip flights are selected.

- **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: Used to associate the cities (ST. PETERSBURG and TORONTO) with their respective airports.
- **CITY**: Used to filter the specific cities.
- **FLIGHT**: Contains flight details, including departure and destination airports.
- **FARE**: Specifies that we are interested in round trip flights by filtering on the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field.
- **JOINs**: Ensure that relevant data from different tables are correctly combined for accurate results.

Please adjust any specific field names (like the exact way to denote round trips) if necessary, as they may vary based on actual data.

Raw LLM Response:
To find all round trip flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI, we need to look for flights that go from New York to Miami and then back from Miami to New York. This query will involve checking both directions of the flights and ensuring that they correspond to each other.

Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT, FLIGHT2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_DEPARTURE, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_ARRIVAL,
     CITY AS CITY_DEPARTURE, CITY AS CITY_ARRIVAL,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT1, FLIGHT AS FLIGHT2
WHERE CITY_DEPARTURE.CITY_CODE = AS_DEPARTURE.CITY_CODE
  AND CITY_DEPARTURE.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND CITY_ARRIVAL.CITY_CODE = AS_ARRIVAL.CITY_CODE
  AND CITY_ARRIVAL.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI'
  AND FLIGHT1.FROM_AIRPORT = AS_DEPARTURE.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT1.TO_AIRPORT = AS_ARRIVAL.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT2.FROM_AIRPORT = AS_ARRIVAL.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT2.TO_AIRPORT = AS_DEPARTURE.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs for both the outbound (from New York to Miami) and return flights (from Miami to New York).
- Using `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the corresponding airport codes for cities.
- The `FLIGHT` table is used to specify the direction of the flights.
- The conditions ensure we capture flights going in both directions between the two cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To show all round trip flights from New York to Miami, the SQL query needs to include the relevant airport services, cities, fares, and flights. Here’s how the SQL query would be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "Y" 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Distinct Flight IDs**: Ensures that we only get unique flight entries.
2. **Airport Services**: Involves linking the airport services with the cities to ensure we're checking the correct routes for New York and Miami.
3. **City Codes**: Filters the records by city names to match New York to Miami.
4. **Flight Conditions**: Conditionals to filter for flights that start from the New York airport and go to the Miami airport.
5. **Round Trip Requirement**: Adds a condition to ensure the fare is for round trip flights.

This query will return all the round-trip flights available between New York and Miami.

Question: show me the round trip tickets from BALTIMORE to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the round trip tickets from Baltimore to Atlanta, you can write the following SQL query. This query will join the necessary tables to find flights from BALTIMORE to ATLANTA and return the relevant fares for round trip travel.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Airlines and Fares**: The query selects the distinct fare IDs and costs for both one-way and round trip fares.
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to determine the airports for BALTIMORE and ATLANTA.
   - `CITY` is used to match city names with their respective codes.
   - `FARE` and `FLIGHT` tables are joined to get fare information corresponding to the flights.
3. **Round Trip Requirement**: The query checks if the fare is marked as requiring a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"`).

This SQL will return all unique round trip fare options for travel from Baltimore to Atlanta.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Query Breakdown:
- **Joins**:
  - It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to `CITY` based on `CITY_CODE` to match cities with the respective airports.
  - It joins `FLIGHT` to `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find flights originating from Houston and landing in Las Vegas.
  - It matches `FLIGHT_FARE` with `FARE` to confirm that the fare is round-trip.

- **Conditions**:
  - Ensure the city names match the respective cities of Houston and Las Vegas.
  - Check that the given flight fare is marked as round-trip.

This query provides a list of all round-trip flight IDs between Houston and Las Vegas. Adjust the names to match your data if they differ.

To retrieve round trip tickets from Baltimore to Atlanta, you can query the necessary tables in your database schema. The following SQL query will yield the round trip tickets available for flights traveling between Baltimore and Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0, FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **DISTINCT**: This ensures that the query results include unique entries.
- **Tables**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT` tables to get the necessary information.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Filters for the cities "BALTIMORE" and "ATLANTA".
  - Ensures that the flights are from Baltimore to Atlanta.
  - Checks that the round trip is required (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).
- **Selected Columns**: It selects the fare ID, one-direction cost, round trip cost, and flight ID for the returned results.

Feel free to adapt or expand this query based on the specific fields needed!

Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip tickets from Baltimore to Dallas, you would need to use a query that selects the relevant information from the database based on the city names and the round trip criteria. Here’s how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 1 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting DISTINCT Flight IDs**: To get unique flight records between Baltimore and Dallas.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - Joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Baltimore and Dallas to find the corresponding airport codes.
   - Joining `CITY` to filter based on city names.
   - Joining `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` to access the flight and fare details.
3. **Conditions**:
   - Ensure it only looks for flights going from Baltimore to Dallas and has the round trip requirement in the fare. 

This query would return all the round trip flight IDs available from Baltimore to Dallas. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the exact structure of your data or if additional filtering or selection criteria are needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flights from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH, you would need to consider both the outbound and return flights in your SQL query. Below is an SQL statement that accomplishes this by using the necessary tables and conditions:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT_out.FLIGHT_ID AS Outbound_Flight, FLIGHT_ret.FLIGHT_ID AS Return_Flight
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_out, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_ret, 
     CITY AS CITY_out, 
     CITY AS CITY_ret, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_out, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_ret
WHERE CITY_out.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_out.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_out.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND CITY_ret.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_ret.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_ret.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND FLIGHT_out.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_out.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_out.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_ret.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_ret.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_ret.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_ret.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_out.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Selecting Distinct Flights**: The query selects distinct flight IDs for both outbound and return flights.
  
2. **Finding Airports**: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is joined with `CITY` to identify the airport code for both Boston and Pittsburgh.

3. **Outbound Flights**: The query first focuses on flights going from Boston to Pittsburgh using the `FLIGHT` table.

4. **Return Flights**: The return flights are fetched in the same manner by querying for flights going from Pittsburgh back to Boston.

Make sure to replace any names or structures that might differ in your actual database schema as needed.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Boston to Pittsburgh, the SQL query will involve looking up the necessary fields from the relevant tables: cities in Boston and Pittsburgh, airport services, flights between these airports, and fare information. Below is a potential SQL query to retrieve the round trip flight information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST, FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- assuming this signifies that it is a round trip fare
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the airports associated with the cities.
   - `CITY` to filter based on the city names ("BOSTON" and "PITTSBURGH").
   - `FLIGHT` to determine the actual flights available between these two airports.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to retrieve fare details specific to the flights.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The condition checks ensure that:
     - The flights are from the airport serving Boston to the airport serving Pittsburgh.
     - The fare is for a round trip (the example assumes that a specific field in the fare table can determine this, in this case `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`).

3. **Selecting Distinct Flights**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique flights are returned even if multiple fare records might exist for the same flight.

Make sure to adjust this query based on your actual database schema particularly concerning what fields exist for round trip requirements or if the conditions change.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round-trip flight from Dallas to Pittsburgh, you would typically need to look at the relevant data related to flights, fares, and the airports involved. Consider the following SQL query to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
       AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES');
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used**:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get airport codes linked to the cities Dallas and Pittsburgh.
  - `CITY` for matching city names with their respective codes.
  - `FLIGHT` to find flights departing from Dallas (FROM_AIRPORT) and arriving in Pittsburgh (TO_AIRPORT).
  - `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get round-trip costs associated with those flights.

- **Conditions**:
  - The cities must match the names "DALLAS" and "PITTSBURGH".
  - The query filters for flights where a round trip is required.

This query provides the distinct flight IDs and their corresponding round-trip costs for the requested journey. Adjust the query based on additional requirements, such as filtering for specific dates or airlines if needed.

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- This query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables.
- It filters for flights departing from ORLANDO to KANSAS CITY by matching the city names with their respective airport service entries.
- It checks that the fare corresponds to round trip flights by verifying that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is set to 'Y'.
- It returns distinct flight IDs (or relevant columns) for the matched round trip flights.

To obtain round trip flights between HOUSTON and LAS VEGAS, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
       AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y');
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter flights from HOUSTON to LAS VEGAS.
- The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that we are only selecting flights that are round trips. 

Make sure that the city names are correctly matched with the corresponding airport services.

Question: which flights go from NEW YORK to MIAMI and back
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights that go from New York to Miami and back, you will need to identify the appropriate airport codes for both locations and then construct a SQL query that selects flights for both legs of the trip (New York to Miami and Miami to New York). Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined twice (as `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0` for New York and `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1` for Miami) to get the respective airport codes.
- `CITY` table is also joined to ensure we are selecting the correct cities.
- The query then identifies flights going from New York to Miami (using `FLIGHTalias0`) and flights returning from Miami to New York (using `FLIGHTalias1`).
- `DISTINCT` is used to avoid duplicate flight IDs in the results.

Make sure to replace 'NEW YORK' and 'MIAMI' with the actual city names in your database if they differ.

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: For connecting city names to their corresponding airport codes.
   - `CITY`: To filter airports based on city names (BURBANK and SEATTLE).
   - `FLIGHT`: To retrieve flights that have appropriate origins and destinations.
   - `FARE` and `FLIGHT_FARE`: To ensure that the flights are round trip.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query checks that the departure city is BURBANK and the arrival city is SEATTLE.
   - It ensures that the flight is a round trip by checking `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`.

3. **Output**:
   - The query returns distinct flight IDs for round trip flights from BURBANK to SEATTLE.

Feel free to adjust the query based on additional constraints or information you may require!

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal, you need to retrieve flights that originate from Orlando and arrive in Montreal, and then also the return flights from Montreal back to Orlando. Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from two sets of flights.
- It checks that one set of flights (aliased as `FLIGHTalias0`) is from Orlando (`FROM_AIRPORT` matches the airport code for Orlando) to Montreal (`TO_AIRPORT` matches the airport code for Montreal).
- The second set of flights (aliased as `FLIGHTalias1`) is for return flights from Montreal back to Orlando.
- Airports are mapped to cities through the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trips between Montreal and Orlando, the SQL query will need to find flights leaving Montreal and returning from Orlando. For this, we will again use the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to link the cities and airports with the flights and fares.

Here is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT_OUT.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT, 
       FLIGHT_RETURN.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_OUT, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_RETURN, 
     CITY AS CITY_OUT, 
     CITY AS CITY_RETURN, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_OUT, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_RETURN 
WHERE (CITY_OUT.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_OUT.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITY_OUT.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
       AND FLIGHT_OUT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_OUT.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_OUT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_RETURN.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND CITY_RETURN.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_RETURN.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITY_RETURN.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
       AND FLIGHT_RETURN.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_RETURN.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_RETURN.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_OUT.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct outbound and return flights (`FLIGHT_OUT` for departing from Montreal to Orlando, and `FLIGHT_RETURN` for returning from Orlando to Montreal).
- The query establishes the relationship between cities, airport services, and flights ensuring that the outbound and return flights are appropriately matched with their respective airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Montreal to Orlando, you would need to query the flight data based on the relevant airports and include details for round trip fares. Here’s the SQL query for your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select DISTINCT**: To fetch unique flight IDs.
2. **FROM**: Tables involved in the query.
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`: Service related to the Montreal city.
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`: Service related to the Orlando city.
   - `CITYalias0`: Represents the city of Montreal.
   - `CITYalias1`: Represents the city of Orlando.
   - `FAREalias0`: Contains fare details.
   - `FLIGHTalias0`: Represents flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FAREalias0`: Links flights to costs.
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for the cities (Montreal and Orlando).
   - Ensures flights are round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).
4. **Join Conditions**: To ensure proper filtering of information across related tables. 

This query will give you a list of all round trip flights available from Montreal to Orlando based on the given schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip flights from BURBANK to TACOMA, you can use a SQL query that retrieves flights originating from BURBANK and heading to TACOMA, ensuring that it captures round trip fares. Here's how you can structure the SQL query based on your provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates that it is a round trip fare
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause:** It selects from several tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` to gather necessary information.
- **WHERE Clause:**
  - Ensures that **Burbank** is the starting city and **Tacoma** is the destination.
  - Validates that the flight details match the corresponding airport codes.
  - Checks that the fare requires a round trip (assuming there is a specific indicator in the `FARE` table).
  
This SQL query will give you the distinct flight IDs representing round trip flights from Burbank to Tacoma. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific database contents and requirements (like filtering by specific dates or times).

Raw LLM Response:
To query for round trip flights from KANSAS CITY to CHICAGO, we would first need to find suitable airport services for both cities and then join them with the flight and fare tables to get the relevant information. Here’s the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
       AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'); 
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: We are joining several tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both origin and destination, `CITY` to filter by city names, `FLIGHT` to get the flight details, and `FLIGHT_FARE` to link fares to those flights.

2. **City Filters**: We filter `CITY` for "KANSAS CITY" and "CHICAGO".

3. **Flight Information**: The query filters to ensure that the `FROM_AIRPORT` is from Kansas City and the `TO_AIRPORT` is to Chicago.

4. **Round Trip Requirement**: We also filter the fare to ensure it's a round trip by checking if `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'YES'.

This query aims to return a list of distinct flight IDs available for round trips from Kansas City to Chicago. You may need to adjust further depending on the specifics of your application (e.g., date restrictions, etc.).

Question: on a flight from SAN FRANCISCO to ATLANTA that leaves before 800 is there such a flight
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from SAN FRANCISCO to ATLANTA that leave before 8:00 AM, you can construct an SQL query similar to the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query retrieves distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table (`FLIGHTalias0`).
- It uses `JOIN` operations to get the correct airport services for both SAN FRANCISCO (`AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`) and ATLANTA (`AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights that have a `DEPARTURE_TIME` earlier than 8:00 AM.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Boston to Denver that depart before 10:00 AM, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0

         AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00' );
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To find the airport codes corresponding to the cities.
   - `CITY`: To match the cities "BOSTON" and "DENVER".
   - `FLIGHT`: To find flight information based on the departure and arrival airports.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query restricts the selection of flights to those departing from Boston and arriving in Denver.
   - Additionally, it specifies that the departure time must be before 10:00 AM.

The query returns a distinct list of flight IDs that meet these criteria.

Question: what flights go from BOSTON to DENVER before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights going from Boston to Denver before 10:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you are interested in the flight's departure time and that Boston and Denver are properly represented in your `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: The query selects from `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Boston and Denver to get their airport codes.
2. **JOIN Conditions**: It matches the city names with their respective codes.
3. **WHERE Clause**: It checks that the flights are from Boston to Denver.
4. **TIME Condition**: It filters out flights that depart before 10 AM.

Make sure to use the right format for `DEPARTURE_TIME`, assuming it is stored in a `HH:MM:SS` format. Adjust based on how your database handles time formats.

Raw LLM Response:
To write an SQL query that retrieves all flights from PITTSBURGH to BOSTON which leave before 1200, we will join the necessary tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`. We need to make sure that we check the flight's departure time against the specified condition. Below is the SQL query for this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We're selecting from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to retrieve the airport code for each city.
2. **JOIN Conditions**: We join the `CITY` table to match the cities of PITTSBURGH and BOSTON with their respective airport services.
3. **Flight Table**: We're selecting from `FLIGHT` to retrieve the flights matching the airport codes.
4. **WHERE Clause**: We specify the conditions to get flights going from PITTSBURGH to BOSTON and leaving before 12:00.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from BOSTON to ATLANTA that depart before 8:00 AM, you can use a SQL statement that aggregates the necessary tables for city and airport information, and filters by departure time. Below is the SQL query you would need:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00');
```

In this SQL query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the correct airport codes for BOSTON and ATLANTA.
- We filter the results to only show flights that depart before 8:00 AM by using the `DEPARTURE_TIME` column in the `FLIGHT` table.

Question: please list all the flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO leaving before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Boston to San Francisco that leave before 10:00 AM, you can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
1. **FROM Clause**: The query pulls data from multiple tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Boston and San Francisco, and `CITY` to verify the city names.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Matches the city codes for Boston and San Francisco.
   - Connects the `FLIGHT` table to these airports.
   - Checks that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before 10:00 AM.
3. **DISTINCT**: Ensures that you get unique flight IDs in the result.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is in the correct format (`'HH:MM:SS'`) based on your database schema.
- Depending on your database's SQL dialect, you might need to adjust the time format or handling as required.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Dallas to Oakland that depart before 12:00 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the tables to join. We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Dallas and Oakland to get the corresponding airport codes.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights departing from Dallas and arriving at Oakland.
   - Checks for flights that depart before 12:00 PM using `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'`.
3. **DISTINCT**: Ensures that the same flight does not appear multiple times in the result.

Make sure the time format `HH:MM:SS` used in the query aligns with the data stored in your database for the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field.

Question: i'm looking for flights from OAKLAND to ATLANTA leaving before 1045
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Oakland to Atlanta that leave before 10:45 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you will use the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to match the cities, along with the `FLIGHT` table to find the flight details and departure times.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:45:00';
```

In this query:
- We join the `CITY` table with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both cities (Oakland and Atlanta).
- We check for flights where the departure time is less than `10:45:00`.
- The query will return distinct flight IDs for the specified criteria.

Question: i'm looking for flights from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA leaving before 900
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA that depart before 9:00 AM, you would use a SQL query that involves the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. Here's how you can structure that query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To relate cities with their respective airports.
   - `CITY`: To filter for the cities PITTSBURGH and PHILADELPHIA.
   - `FLIGHT`: To get the details about the flights including their departure times.

2. **Filters**:
   - The `CITYNAME` fields are checked for "PITTSBURGH" and "PHILADELPHIA" to ensure we're looking at the right two cities.
   - The `DEPARTURE_TIME` is compared to `'09:00:00'` to fetch only flights that leave before 9:00 AM. 

3. **Selecting Distinct Flights**: This prevents duplicates in case multiple records match the criteria.

Make sure to adjust the formatting as per your database's date and time standards if needed.

To retrieve flights from Tampa to St. Louis that leave before 10:00 AM on any day, you can construct the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: Select unique flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1**: Join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both departing and arriving cities.
- **CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1**: References to retrieve details about departing (TAMPA) and arriving (ST. LOUIS) cities.
- **WHERE**: 
  - Conditions to filter for the specific cities and match the airport service codes for both.
  - Additionally, the departure time is checked to be before 10 AM (`FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'`). 

Make sure to adjust the time format if needed, depending on your database's time representation.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight times for flights from Boston to Baltimore that depart in the morning before 8:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to find the corresponding airport codes for Boston and Baltimore.
   - `CITY` is used to match city names with their corresponding codes.
   - `FLIGHT` is used to get the actual flight information including departure times.

2. **Filters**:
   - The query ensures we're looking for flights departing from Boston (after filtering with `CITY_NAME`).
   - It checks that the destination is Baltimore and filters flights with `DEPARTURE_TIME` before 8 AM (`'08:00:00'`). 

This query will return a list of unique flight IDs and their departure times that match the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
Here is a SQL query that retrieves flights from Cleveland (Cleveland, Ohio) to Dallas (Dallas, Texas) that leave before 12:00 PM. This query will ensure that it's correctly formatted while minimizing unnecessary complexity:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID`: This selects unique flight IDs.
- The `FROM` clause sets up the necessary joins between the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results:
  - Matches Cleveland and Dallas from their respective city tables.
  - Filters flights based on their `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`.
  - Ensures that the departure time (`DEPARTURE_TIME`) is before noon (`'12:00:00'`). 

This SQL should provide the requested information without excess detail.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 9:00 AM, you would need to write an SQL query using the relevant tables. Here is the SQL statement you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We are joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter flights based on the departing city (Cincinnati) and the destination city (Tampa).
- We then check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before `09:00:00`.

Question: list flights from CINCINNATI to TAMPA before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 12:00, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter the airports corresponding to Cincinnati and Tampa.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'` ensures that only flights departing before noon are included in the results.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To show the flights from Houston to Dallas that depart before 12:00 PM (0:00 in a 24-hour format), we would structure the SQL query as follows. I'm assuming the intention is to identify flights leaving from Houston before noon:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the query:
- **DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: Selects unique flight IDs to avoid duplicates.
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FLIGHT**: Joins relevant tables to access city names and flight information.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results:
    - Ensures we are looking at flights from Houston to Dallas.
    - Checks that the departure time of flights is before noon (12:00 PM).

Ensure to adjust `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME` as necessary based on how time is stored in your database (e.g., as a string, DateTime, etc.).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

```

### Explanation:
- **FROM**: We're selecting from `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to match the city codes with the corresponding airports for both Indianapolis and Memphis.
- **WHERE**: We're checking:
  - That the city names match with their corresponding airport service entries.
  - That the flight is departing from Indianapolis (`FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT`) and arriving in Memphis (`FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT`).
  - That the `DEPARTURE_TIME` of the flight is before 12:00 PM.
- **DISTINCT**: This ensures that the results list unique flight IDs only. 

You can run this query against your database to retrieve the desired information.

Question: show me all direct flights from SAN FRANCISCO to BOSTON departing before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.CONNECTIONS = connections0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
Certainly! To find all direct flights from San Francisco to Boston that depart before 12:00 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'
      AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- This ensures the flight is direct
```

### Explanation:
1. **DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: Selects unique flight IDs from the results.
2. **JOINs**: Using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to map the airport codes for San Francisco and Boston.
3. **Conditions**: 
   - The flights must depart from San Francisco's airport and arrive at Boston's airport.
   - The departure time must be before 12:00 PM.
   - `AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0`: This condition is assumed to identify direct flights (no stops). Note that the `STOPS` column must exist in your `FLIGHT` table; otherwise, adjust the query accordingly to reflect how direct flights are determined.

This query provides you with a list of direct flights that meet your criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights departing from Chicago and arriving in Detroit around 6 PM, you can use the following SQL query. This query will search for flights that leave from the Chicago area (defined through its airport services) and arrive in the Detroit area (also defined through its airport services) within a specific time range around 6 PM.

Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:30:00' AND '18:30:00';  -- Adjust the time range for your requirement.
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE**: This table is used to find the appropriate airport codes for both Chicago and Detroit based on their city names.
- **JOIN between CITY and AIRPORT_SERVICE**: This allows us to link city names to their respective airport codes.
- **FLIGHT selection**: We're filtering the flights where the departure airport is in Chicago and the arrival airport is in Detroit.
- **ARRIVAL_TIME filter**: We check the flight's arrival time to ensure it falls within a half-hour window around 6 PM (5:30 PM to 6:30 PM).

Make sure to adjust the time range as necessary to fully align with your specific requirements for "around 6 PM."

Question: show me the flights arriving around noon in BALTIMORE from DENVER
SQL:

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights arriving around noon in Baltimore from Denver, we can query the relevant tables to filter the results based on the departure and arrival city, as well as the time of arrival. Here's an SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '11:30:00' AND '12:30:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **Filtering by Cities:** The query uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to verify the departure city (Denver) and arrival city (Baltimore).
- **Flight Selection:** `FLIGHT` table is queried to retrieve flights departing from Denver and arriving in Baltimore.
- **Arrival Time Condition:** The condition `FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '11:30:00' AND '12:30:00'` specifies that we want flights that arrive approximately around noon. You can adjust these timings as necessary based on your specific definition of "around noon".

This single query gathers all the required information succinctly and should provide a clear list of flights that meet the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To find your choices of flights from CHARLOTTE to MINNEAPOLIS arriving around 7 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MINNEAPOLIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '18:30:00' AND '19:30:00'; 
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins multiple tables to get information about airports and cities.
2. **City Filters**: It filters for CHARLOTTE for the `FROM_AIRPORT` and MINNEAPOLIS for the `TO_AIRPORT`.
3. **Time Filter**: It checks that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` of the flights falls within a 1-hour window around 7 PM (from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM).

This will give you a list of flight IDs that satisfy these conditions. You can customize the arrival time window as needed based on how strict you want the requirement around the 7 PM arrival to be.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE that arrive between 16:00 and 17:00, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '16:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: The `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables are used to gather the necessary information about the flights.
2. **WHERE Clause**: Filters for the source city (PITTSBURGH) and destination city (BALTIMORE).
3. **Arrival Time Filtering**: It specifies that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` must be greater than or equal to '16:00:00' and less than '17:00:00', ensuring we get only those flights arriving in that time range.
4. **DISTINCT**: Ensures that each flight ID is returned only once, even if there are multiple matching records.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting DISTINCT FLIGHT_ID**: We want unique flight IDs for the flights that match our criteria.
2. **Tables Used**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to gather the necessary information about the flights.
3. **City Matching**: We filter for flights that depart from Atlanta and arrive in Philadelphia.
4. **Arrival Time Filter**: The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is filtered to be between 4 PM (16:00) and 6 PM (18:00) to capture flights arriving "around 5 o'clock."

Question: is there a flight from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE that arrives between 1800 and 1900
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query whether there is a flight from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE that arrives between 1800 and 1900, you can use SQL to join relevant tables and filter for the specific conditions. Here's the SQL statement to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '18:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '19:00';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **FROM**: Specifies the base tables to retrieve the data from, including `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both the departure and destination airports, and `CITY` for mapping city names to city codes.
- **WHERE**: 
  - Filters for flights departing from PITTSBURGH and arriving in BALTIMORE.
  - Checks that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` falls within the specified time range (between 1800 and 1900).
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: Ensures that each resulting flight ID is unique in the output.

This query will return any flight IDs that meet the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from KANSAS CITY to ST. PAUL that arrives around dinnertime (around 6 PM), you would want to filter flights based on the departure airport, arrival airport, and the arrival time falling within a certain range. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:30:00' AND '18:30:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We join the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY`) to identify the airport codes for both KANSAS CITY and ST. PAUL.
2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - We filter for flights departing from KANSAS CITY (first city) and arriving in ST. PAUL (second city).
   - We also specify that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` must be between 5:30 PM (17:30) and 6:30 PM (18:30) to accommodate arrivals around 6 PM.
3. **SELECT DISTINCT**: This ensures that we only get unique flight IDs in the output.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Indianapolis to Montreal in the evening, you'll need to select flights departing from the airport serving Indianapolis to the airport serving Montreal, ensuring that the departure time is during the evening hours (typically considered to be after 5 PM). Below is a SQL query that fetches this information based on your database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00';  -- Assuming evening starts at 5 PM
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used**: 
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To associate cities with their respective airports.
  - `CITY`: To identify the correct cities (Indianapolis and Montreal).
  - `FLIGHT`: To fetch flight information based on the departure and arrival airports.
- **Filtering Conditions**:
  - The query filters for flights that are from Indianapolis and to Montreal.
  - It checks that the departure time is greater than or equal to 5 PM (17:00).

Feel free to adjust the timing as per your definition of "evening" if necessary!

Question: i'd like a flight from KANSAS CITY to LOS ANGELES that arrives in LOS ANGELES in the late afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from KANSAS CITY to LOS ANGELES that arrives in LOS ANGELES in the late afternoon, we would need to define what "late afternoon" means, typically around 3 PM to 6 PM. We will structure the SQL query accordingly by looking for flights between the two cities and filtering on the arrival time.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '15:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables for both KANSAS CITY and LOS ANGELES to get the relevant airport codes.
- We then look for flights (`FLIGHT`) that depart from KANSAS CITY (using the appropriate airport code) and arrive in LOS ANGELES (also by airport code).
- The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is filtered to be between 3 PM (`'15:00:00'`) and 6 PM (`'18:00:00'`), which falls under the late afternoon category. 

This query structure will return all the flights that meet the specified criteria.

Question: show me the flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO that arrive in the afternoon
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO that arrive in the afternoon, you can use the following SQL query. The definition of "afternoon" typically corresponds to any arrival time between 12:00 PM (noon) and 5:59 PM. We also need to ensure the necessary joins with the airports and cities involved.

Here’s the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE)
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joins**: The main entities involved (flights and cities currently served) are linked correctly through the airport service and city tables.
2. **City Filtering**: Filters cities to match "BOSTON" for the departure airport and "SAN FRANCISCO" for the destination.
3. **Arrival Time Filter**: The condition for arrival time ensures that the flights arriving are only considered if they arrive in the afternoon.
4. **Distinct Flights**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate flight IDs are avoided in the result set.

This query will yield a list of flight IDs that match the criteria specified.

To retrieve the flights from ST. PETERSBURG to TORONTO that arrive early in the morning, we would typically define "early morning" as arrivals before a certain time, such as 09:00 AM (0900 in a 24-hour format). Below is an SQL query that follows this logic:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '0900';
```

In this query:
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find the correct airport codes for ST. PETERSBURG and TORONTO.
- We filter flights that have an arrival time before 09:00 AM.
- Only distinct flight IDs are selected. 

Make sure you adjust the time condition (`FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '0900'`) depending on your specific definition of "early morning".

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight between BOSTON and PHILADELPHIA that arrives in PHILADELPHIA close to 5 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '16:30:00' AND '17:30:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables for both BOSTON and PHILADELPHIA using their respective city codes.
- The departure and arrival city names are compared to ensure we're looking for flights from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA.
- The condition on `ARRIVAL_TIME` checks for flights that arrive between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM (to allow some flexibility around 5 PM). Adjust the time range as necessary based on your definition of "close to 5 PM."

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Las Vegas to Los Angeles that arrive in the late afternoon, we can specify time constraints for the arrival time. Assuming "late afternoon" refers to the time period between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM, we'll construct the SQL query accordingly.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '16:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '18:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We are joining the appropriate tables to find flights from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.
- We filter the results to include only flights that arrive between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM by checking the `ARRIVAL_TIME` column. 

You may need to adjust the `ARRIVAL_TIME` format based on your database's time format specifications.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS that arrives in DALLAS around 12 noon, you'll need to select the appropriate details from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '11:45:00' AND '12:15:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Distinct Flights**: The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause is used to ensure that you get unique flight IDs.
2. **From the Proper Tables**: The `FROM` clause includes all necessary tables that contain the required data for cities, airports, and flights.
3. **City and Airport Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause joins the city codes and names to ensure that we're looking for flights departing from PHILADELPHIA and arriving in DALLAS.
4. **Arrival Time Constraint**: The condition checks for any flights arriving in DALLAS around 12 noon, allowing for a small time window (between 11:45 AM and 12:15 PM). Adjust the time range as needed based on your preferences for "around noon."

Question: show flights from DENVER to OAKLAND arriving between 0 and 100 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Denver to Oakland that arrive between 00:00 and 01:00 (0 and 100 hours), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '00:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '01:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **FROM Clause**: It joins the required tables to get the necessary details about the flights and cities.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - It filters the results to include only those flights that are departing from Denver and arriving in Oakland.
   - The arrival time condition checks that the flight arrives between 00:00 and 01:00.
3. **DISTINCT**: This is used to ensure that each flight ID is unique in the results.

Make sure that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` field is in a format that supports comparison with strings in the format 'HH:MM:SS'. Adjust the query accordingly if the format is different.

Raw LLM Response:
Certainly! Here’s the SQL query to list the flights arriving in Atlanta from Boston between the hours of 16:00 (4 PM) and 20:00 (8 PM):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '16:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '20:00';
```

In this query:
- We're joining the necessary tables to get the details of flights from Boston to Atlanta.
- The condition checks for arrival times between 16:00 and 20:00.
- We're selecting distinct flight IDs to ensure there are no duplicates in the results.

Question: show me the flights arriving in BALTIMORE from PHILADELPHIA at about 4 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights arriving in Baltimore from Philadelphia at around 4 o'clock, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '15:30:00' AND '16:30:00');
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to identify the airports for Philadelphia and Baltimore.
- We are also using `CITY` table to provide more clarity on the cities.
- The `FLIGHT` table is used to get the flights that operate between these two locations.
- The arrival time is filtered to be between 3:30 PM and 4:30 PM to encompass "around 4 o'clock." You can adjust these times if needed to be more precise.

Question: could you tell me about flights from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS that arrives in the early afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
Certainly! To retrieve information about flights from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS that arrive in the early afternoon, we first need to define what "early afternoon" means. For our purposes, let's assume it refers to flights that arrive between 12:00 PM (noon) and 3:00 PM. Below is a SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE)
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '15:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We are selecting from the appropriate tables that link flights to their originating and destination cities.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - We filter for flights that originate from PHILADELPHIA and end at DALLAS using the respective city and airport services.
   - We then apply additional conditions to ensure the arrival time of the flights falls between 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM.
3. **SELECT Distinct**: We ensure only unique flight IDs are returned.

This query will give you the IDs of the flights, as well as their arrival and departure times that meet the specified criteria. Modify the exact logic if you need to define "early afternoon" differently!

Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip flights between Atlanta and Denver that qualify for the fare code "QX," you'll want to join the relevant tables and apply the necessary conditions. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "QX";
```

### Explanation:

1. **Table Joins**:
   - We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Atlanta and Denver to find the associated airport codes using their respective city names.
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table to find flights that correspond to those airport codes.
   - We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to filter flights based on the fare code "QX".

2. **Conditions**:
   - We set conditions to filter out flights from Atlanta to Denver.
   - We specifically check for flights that have a fare basis matching "QX".

This will return a distinct list of flight IDs that meet the criteria.

Question: show me the fares from WASHINGTON to OAKLAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To show the fares from WASHINGTON to OAKLAND, you would need to join the relevant tables to access airport information, city information, and fare details. Below is the SQL query that retrieves the fares between these two cities:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON";
```

### Explanation:
1. `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0` is tied to the `CITYalias0` which represents WASHINGTON.
2. `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1` is tied to `CITYalias1` which represents OAKLAND.
3. The fares are then fetched from the `FARE` table based on the FROM and TO airports derived from the AIRPORT_SERVICE tables.
4. The query retrieves distinct fare IDs along with their one-way and round-trip costs. 

Make sure to adjust any column references if needed based on your actual data or requirements!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the costs of flights from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA, you will need to join relevant tables that provide the necessary information regarding airport services, flights, and fares. Here's the SQL query that combines these elements to answer the question:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

1. **Table Joins**:
    - The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined twice to get the relevant airports for both BALTIMORE and PHILADELPHIA.
    - The `CITY` table is used to retrieve the city codes for BALTIMORE and PHILADELPHIA.
    - The `FARE` and `FLIGHT` tables allow retrieval of fare information and the specific flights between these cities.

2. **Columns Selected**:
    - The query selects the `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` fields from the `FARE` table, along with the `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table to identify which flights correspond to the prices being listed.

3. **Conditions**:
    - It filters the cities and airports appropriately to ensure only the flights from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA are considered.

This query will return the cost of each flight as well as the corresponding `FLIGHT_ID` for flights going from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA.

To find the price of flights from Indianapolis to Memphis, you will need to join the relevant tables to get the flight fare information based on the departure and arrival airports. Below is the SQL query that fulfills this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`: Information about Indianapolis and its airport.
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`: Information about Memphis and its airport.
   - `CITYalias0` and `CITYalias1`: Represent the details for Indianapolis and Memphis respectively.
   - `FLIGHTalias0`: Contains information about flights.
   - `FLIGHT_FAREalias0`: Links flights to their respective fares.
   - `FAREalias0`: Contains fare information, including one-direction and round trip costs.

2. **JOIN Conditions**:
   - The cities are matched to their respective airport services which provide the airport codes.
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined on `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` to get relevant flights leaving from Indianapolis to Memphis.
   - Finally, the fare information is accessed through `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve the flight prices.

This query will give you the one-way and round-trip costs for flights from Indianapolis to Memphis.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the price of a flight from Cleveland to Nashville, you'll need to look up the appropriate airports, the FARE table, and potentially the FLIGHT and FLIGHT_FARE tables to get the corresponding pricing information. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

This query will give you the `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` for flights departing from Cleveland and arriving in Nashville, assuming there are corresponding flights and fares available in the database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fare from WASHINGTON to BOSTON, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
          SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID

          JOIN FARE AS FAREalias1 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias1.FARE_ID
      );
```

This query retrieves the fares for flights that go from WASHINGTON to BOSTON by joining the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE`. It extracts both one-direction and round-trip costs for the flights between the specified cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flight cost between DENVER and ATLANTA, you need to join the relevant tables that contain information about the origin and destination airports, the flights, and the associated fares. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

This query retrieves the costs for one-way flights (`ONE_DIRECTION_COST`) and round-trip flights (`ROUND_TRIP_COST`) between DENVER and ATLANTA by joining the necessary tables based on city and airport information.

### Explanation:
- **JOIN Operations**: 
  - The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is first joined to get the airport codes for BOSTON and DENVER via their respective city codes.
  - The `FLIGHT` table is then joined to find flights that depart from the BOSTON airport and arrive at the DENVER airport.
  - The `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables are joined to retrieve the cost details of the flights.

- **Selected Columns**: 
  - `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table give you the pricing details for one-way and round-trip flights respectively.

This query will provide you with the necessary information about the costs of flights between BOSTON and DENVER.

Question: please show me all fares for flights from DENVER to OAKLAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all fares for flights from Denver to Oakland, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.*
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- This query starts by joining several tables to correlate the city names to their respective airport codes.
- It specifies that the flight must be departing from Denver (denoted by the `FROM_AIRPORT`) and arriving in Oakland (`TO_AIRPORT`).
- The query selects all columns from the `FARE` table (`FAREalias0.*`) associated with flights that meet the specified criteria. 
- It also ensures the connections between the flights and their corresponding fare IDs using the `FLIGHT_FARE` table. 

Please replace `'DENVER'` and `'OAKLAND'` with the exact string values you have in your database if they differ or if you need any specific conditions.

Raw LLM Response:
To show prices of flights from Baltimore to Dallas, we will need to use the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find the airport codes for Baltimore and Dallas, `FLIGHT` to get the flights between these airports, and `FARE` along with `FLIGHT_FARE` to obtain the associated prices.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To find specific airport services linked to the cities.
   - `CITY`: To get the city codes for Baltimore and Dallas.
   - `FLIGHT`: To find available flights between these two airports.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To get the fare information for the relevant flights.
   - `FARE`: To get the cost details of the flights.

2. **Filters**:
   - We search specifically for flights that are departing from Baltimore to Dallas on the basis of the city names.

3. **Distinct Values**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate records in the output.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from Dallas to Baltimore, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join together the required tables to find the fares associated with flights from the Dallas area (DAL) to the Baltimore area:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: to find airport codes for both Dallas and Baltimore.
   - `CITY`: to map city names to city codes.
   - `FLIGHT`: to fetch flights originating from Dallas to Baltimore.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: to link flights to their respective fares.
   - `FARE`: to fetch fare details for the flights.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Selecting Dallas and Baltimore from the `CITY` table.
   - Joining through the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields in the `FLIGHT` table.

3. **Output**: 
   - The query outputs distinct fare IDs along with one-way and round-trip costs.

Ensure that city names for Dallas and Baltimore accurately reflect how they are stored in the database to retrieve the correct fare information effectively.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of flights from DALLAS to BALTIMORE, you can join the relevant tables to get the flight details along with the corresponding fare prices. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FARE AS FAREalias0,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **DISTINCT**: Ensures that the resulting rows are unique.
2. **FROM clauses**: Includes relevant tables to gather necessary information: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` (for airport codes), `CITY` (for city names), `FLIGHT` (for flight details), and `FARE` (for pricing information).
3. **WHERE conditions**: Filter for flights from "DALLAS" to "BALTIMORE", ensuring we match the correct cities and gather their respective airport codes.
4. **Selection**: Retrieves the flight ID along with the one-way and round-trip costs for those flights.

This query will provide you with the fare information for flights departing from DALLAS to BALTIMORE.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of all flights from Atlanta to Washington, you'll need to join the relevant tables to ensure you're getting the flight data, fares, and the specific airports for Atlanta and Washington. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used**:
  - **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: To find the corresponding airport codes for Atlanta and Washington.
  - **CITY**: To ensure that we're matching the correct city names to their codes.
  - **FLIGHT**: Provides the flight ID and routing information.
  - **FLIGHT_FARE**: Links the flights to their corresponding fares.
  - **FARE**: Contains the pricing information for one-way and round-trip costs.

- **Conditions**:
  - Filters to ensure that you're looking for flights specifically from Atlanta to Washington.
  
This query will return a unique list of flight IDs along with their one-direction and round-trip costs.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the airfare between Denver and Pittsburgh, we need to select the relevant fare information based on flights between the two cities. Below is an SQL query designed to retrieve the airfare information for one-way flights. This query can also be adapted for round trips if desired.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, 
                FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
                FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST

  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The query retrieves distinct fare information (ONE_DIRECTION_COST and ROUND_TRIP_COST) relating to flights from Denver to Pittsburgh.
- It joins the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` to find the necessary fare data corresponding to flights between the two cities. 
- The `WHERE` clause filters for the specified city names and ensures the appropriate relationships between the tables, ensuring to pull fares associated with the corresponding flights. 

You can adjust the `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0` and `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1` as needed to filter for round trip or one-way specifics as per requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of flying from Boston to Atlanta, we need to identify the round trip fare from the relevant airports in those cities. We can achieve that by querying the `FARE` table along with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the necessary airport codes for Boston and Atlanta. Below is the SQL query to obtain this information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA"
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We select the one-direction cost and round-trip cost from the `FARE` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to filter out the relevant airports for Boston and Atlanta.
- We then filter the fares that are relevant to flights from Boston to Atlanta. 

This will give you details about the cost to fly from Boston to Atlanta.

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To link cities to their respective airport codes.
   - `CITY`: To filter cities by name (WASHINGTON and BOSTON).
   - `FLIGHT`: To find flights from WASHINGTON to BOSTON.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To get the fare associated with each flight.
   - `FARE`: To get pricing information for flights.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We filter by the city names to ensure we have the correct airport codes.
   - We join the tables based on the relevant relationships: flights to/from the airports and fares related to those flights.

3. **Output**:
   - The query selects distinct costs for one-way and round-trip fares (`ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST`).

Note: Make sure that the database has been populated correctly and that relevant connections exist. Depending on the database's integrity, results may vary based on the data available.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from Dallas to San Francisco, you can construct the SQL query using the provided database schema. Here’s a suitable SQL query for that requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = 
      (SELECT FARE_FARE_ID
       FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
       WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID);
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: This part joins the necessary tables to find the unique connection from Dallas to San Francisco. It includes `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both cities, `CITY` for city identification, `FARE` for fare details, and `FLIGHT` to link routes.
2. **WHERE Conditions**: 
   - Match Dallas and San Francisco using their city names and corresponding city codes.
   - Ensure the flights are appropriately linked from the departure airport in Dallas to the arrival airport in San Francisco.
3. **Fare Selection**: Subquery retrieves fare IDs associated with the flights from the main query to ensure that only relevant fare information is returned.

This query will provide you with the fare information from Dallas to San Francisco, including the fare IDs and costs. Please ensure your database environment recognizes table and column names as specified in your schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To find out how much a flight costs from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL, you need to consider the fare details and the corresponding flights between these two cities. The following SQL query can be used to retrieve the fare information for flights from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

This query accomplishes the following:
1. It selects the distinct fare information for flights departing from WASHINGTON ("WASHINGTON") and arriving at MONTREAL ("MONTREAL").
2. It joins various tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FLIGHT, FLIGHT_FARE, and FARE) based on the relationships defined in the database schema to get to the required fare details.
3. The results will include both one-direction and round-trip costs, if applicable.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a flight from Boston to San Francisco, we can use the relevant tables to connect the cities, airport services, flights, and fares. Here's how the SQL query could be constructed:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON";
```

### Explanation:
1. **From**:
   - **AIRPORT_SERVICE** joins with **CITY** to find the airport(s) associated with Boston.
   - Similarly, it joins with **AIRPORT_SERVICE** for San Francisco.

2. **Join FLIGHT**: 
   - This connects the retrieved airports for both cities to find relevant flights.

3. **Join FLIGHT_FARE**: 
   - This captures the fares related to the identified flights.

4. **Select Costs**:
   - The query selects the one-way and round-trip costs from **FARE**.

This query will provide you with the cost of the flights from Boston to San Francisco. Make sure to execute the SQL in a suitable database environment with the underlying schema to retrieve the desired information accurately.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of flights from Denver to San Francisco, you would need to consider the relevant tables and join them appropriately. Here's the SQL query you would use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The query selects the `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table.
- It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find the correct airport codes for Denver and San Francisco.
- It joins `CITY` to confirm the city names.
- It links the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to ensure you are getting fares associated with available flights between the two cities.

Make sure to replace the `CITY_NAME` values if you have any specific naming conventions that differ, e.g., if the database uses "SAN FRANCISCO" versus "SF".

  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct fare details (with `FARE_ID`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, and `ROUND_TRIP_COST`) for flights from PITTSBURGH to SAN FRANCISCO.
- It uses joins on the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to filter the results based on the source and destination cities.
- Make sure to adjust the query if you require additional details or specific fare conditions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the prices of flights from Baltimore to Dallas, you can write a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to filter for flights from the appropriate airports and includes fare information. Here’s how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: The query selects data from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables.
- **WHERE Clause**: It filters for flights where:
  - The city name for `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0` is Baltimore.
  - The city name for `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1` is Dallas.
  - The `FLIGHT` is from Baltimore to Dallas.
- **Selected Columns**: The `FLIGHT_ID`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` are selected to show the flight's ID and its fares.

This query will give you all the available flight prices from Baltimore to Dallas based on the schema provided.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the fare from Dallas to San Francisco, you can join the relevant tables such as `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`. Below is the SQL query to retrieve the fare:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, 
                FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
                FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST

  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

This query retrieves the fare details for flights between Dallas and San Francisco, including one-way and round-trip costs. Make sure that the `CITY` names match exactly as they appear in the database.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the air fares for flights from Baltimore to Dallas, we will need to join several tables including the cities, airport services, flights, fares, and flight fares. Here's the SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

In this query:
- We are performing the necessary joins to link the cities Baltimore and Dallas with their respective airport services.
- We gather all flight data that connects these two airports.
- Finally, we select the fare details (like one-way and round-trip costs) associated with those flights. 

Make sure to replace the city names with the exact values as used in your database if they are case-sensitive or formatted differently.

Question: price of flight from NASHVILLE to CLEVELAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the price of a flight from Nashville to Cleveland, you need to consider the relevant tables that contain the pricing and flight information—namely `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY`. The SQL query below assumes that the database structure is consistent with the schema provided.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE)
AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Nashville and Cleveland to get the airport codes.
2. **City Code Filtering**: It filters based on the city names Nashville and Cleveland to find their corresponding city codes.
3. **Flight Information**: It connects `FLIGHT` to identify flights from Nashville to Cleveland.
4. **Fare Information**: It retrieves the fare associated with those flights using `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get pricing details (both one-way and round-trip costs).
5. **Distinct Selection**: Using `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate flight entries based on fares. 

When executed, this query should return the pricing details for flights from Nashville to Cleveland.

Question: how much does it cost to fly from ATLANTA to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of flying from ATLANTA to SAN FRANCISCO, you will need to join relevant tables that provide the route details and fare information. Here's a SQL query that can help you accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
                                   FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
                                   JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 
                                   ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` tables to connect the cities of Atlanta and San Francisco with their respective airport codes.
2. **Filters**: It filters the entries to ensure the departure is from ATLANTA and the destination is SAN FRANCISCO.
3. **Fare IDs**: The subquery retrieves flight fares for the identified flights to get current fares.
4. **Result**: The result provides the one-way and round-trip costs to fly from ATLANTA to SAN FRANCISCO.

Make sure you have actual data in your database as this query relies on matching entries existing for both airports and fares.

Raw LLM Response:
To find fares from Seattle to Minneapolis, we will need to join the relevant tables to link the cities, their respective airports, and the fares associated with flights between those airports. Here’s how the SQL query could be structured based on the given database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MINNEAPOLIS"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct fare IDs and costs from the `FARE` table.
- We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to link airports in Seattle and Minneapolis to their respective cities.
- We join `FLIGHT` to find outbound flights from Seattle to Minneapolis.
- Finally, we join on `FLIGHT_FARE` to connect the fares with each flight. 

This query will provide a list of fares from Seattle to Minneapolis for all the flights available.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a round trip fare from New York to San Jose, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you are interested in direct flights and that the minimum cost for a round trip should be fetched:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUTE, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN JOSE'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:

1. **Table Joins**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to gather necessary information about flights and fares.
2. **Condition Filters**: It filters the cities for New York and San Jose, and ensures we are looking for flights from NY to San Jose and back.
3. **Round Trip Requirement**: The column `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is checked to ensure that only round-trip fares are selected.

Make sure to replace the field `FAREalias0.ROUTE` in the select with the appropriate column that denotes the routing information if such exists; otherwise, adjust the query accordingly to suit the required output.

Question: could you please give me the round trip fare from DENVER to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the round trip fare from Denver to Atlanta, you can use the following SQL query. This query looks for fares based on the route from Denver to Atlanta, ensuring that you extract the round trip fare.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Joined**: 
    - We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get the cities Denver and Atlanta.
    - The `CITY` table is used to map city names to their codes.
    - The `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables are joined to obtain the fare details.

2. **Filters**:
    - The query filters for a flight using the FROM and TO airports corresponding to Denver and Atlanta respectively.
    - The round trip fare is specifically selected where `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is indicated as 'Y'.

3. **Result**: 
   - You will get a distinct list of round trip costs from Denver to Atlanta based on available flights.

Question: show me round trip fares from DENVER to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip fares from Denver to Philadelphia, you will need to join relevant tables, including the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to associate fare information with the respective flights. Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- `SELECT DISTINCT` ensures that each fare is unique in the result set.
- The `FROM` clause combines the relevant tables needed to find the round trip fares, namely `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to ensure we are fetching fares for flights from Denver to Philadelphia.
- `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` filters the fares to only include round trip fares.

This query will return all distinct round trip fare IDs and their costs for flights from Denver to Philadelphia. Be sure to adjust column names or conditions based on your actual database schema if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip fares from NEW YORK to MIAMI, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates round trip required
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Distinct Fare IDs**: We are selecting distinct fare IDs and round trip costs from the `FARE` table.
2. **Airport Services**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to connect cities to their respective airports.
3. **City Condition**: We specify that we want to travel from "NEW YORK" to "MIAMI".
4. **Flight Condition**: It links the flights to the airports by checking `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`.
5. **Round Trip Requirement**: The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` filters for only round trip fares.

Make sure to adapt the condition on round trip required according to the actual data representation in your database schema if necessary.

- **FROM Clause**: We are joining the necessary tables to retrieve the data about fares, flights, and airports.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters to ensure we only consider flights that depart from Pittsburgh and arrive in Oakland, along with proper mappings of cities to the airport services.
- **DISTINCT**: Ensures we don't return duplicate fare records.
- **ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED**: This condition ensures that we are only analyzing round-trip fares. Adjust this based on how the database represents round-trip requirements.

Make sure to review the necessary conditions and modify them according to the actual schema definitions (e.g., for round trip requirement).

Question: please give me round trip fares from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia, you would want to gather the necessary attributes from the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT...**: This part selects unique round trip fare IDs along with their costs.
- **FROM...**: This clause indicates which tables to pull data from: the various airport service tables (to find appropriate city codes), the fare tables (for costs), and the flight tables (which relate flights to fares).
- **WHERE...**: The conditions in the WHERE clause ensure that we are checking for flights departing from Baltimore and arriving in Philadelphia while also confirming that the fares are specifically for round trips (where `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 1`).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins different tables to relate cities, airports, flights, and fares.
- It filters for the specified cities "PITTSBURGH" and "PHILADELPHIA" to get the relevant airport services.
- It ensures that only round trip costs are selected by checking `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`. Adjust this condition if the value differs in your schema. 
- The `DISTINCT` clause ensures that you do not get duplicate round trip fares in the result.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the round trip fares from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA based on your database schema, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE)
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Distinct Rows**: The query selects distinct `FARE_ID` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` to avoid duplication in the result.
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to retrieve the `CITY_CODE` associated with both PITTSBURGH and PHILADELPHIA.
   - `FLIGHT` is used to connect the routing from the originating airport to the destination airport.
   - `FARE` and `FLIGHT_FARE` connect the fare information relevant to the flights.
3. **Round Trip Condition**: It filters for fares where `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'Y', ensuring only round trip fares are retrieved.
4. **Conditions**: The WHERE clause ensures that the flights operate between the specified cities.

This will provide a list of the round trip fares available from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from New York to San Jose, we need to join the relevant tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` to filter out the flights between the two cities and get the round trip fares. Here's how the SQL query can be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

In this query:
- We are checking for flights that depart from New York and arrive in San Jose.
- We are interested in the round trip costs, hence we filter with `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of a round trip flight from PITTSBURGH to SAN FRANCISCO, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the necessary tables to find the flights between the specified cities and extract their round-trip costs:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
                              AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

In this query:
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with `CITY` to filter airports in PITTSBURGH and SAN FRANCISCO.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined to find valid flights between the two airport codes.
- Finally, we link the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to obtain the desired round-trip cost. 

Make sure to replace any specific placeholders (`city_name`, etc.) with the actual value if the query is part of a more extensive SQL script or application context.

Question: show me round trip fares from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia, you can utilize the following SQL query. This query will select relevant fare information between the two cities by referencing the necessary tables for airport service, city, and fare:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.*
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates the fare is for round trips
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Distinct Fares**: The query selects distinct fare information from the `FARE` table.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to identify Baltimore's and Philadelphia's airport codes.
   - It links the `CITY` table to get the respective city names based on their codes.
   - It connects the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to link flight information to the fare information.
3. **Conditions**: The conditions ensure that the query filters results for flights going from Baltimore to Philadelphia and that the fares selected are round trip (based on a hypothetical column `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` that indicates the fare's nature).

Make sure to tailor the column and table names according to your specific schema version if there are variations.

Raw LLM Response:
The SQL query to find the round trip fare from MEMPHIS to SEATTLE would typically involve joining relevant tables to get the fare information based on the cities and their related airport codes. 

Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip fare.
```

In this query:
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the appropriate airport codes for MEMPHIS and SEATTLE.
- Then, we link to the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to access the fares available for those flights.
- We finally filter to ensure that only round trip fares are selected.

Question: list a round trip fare from KANSAS CITY to MINNEAPOLIS flights
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list the round trip fares from Kansas City to Minneapolis flights, you will need to query multiple tables, including those for airports, cities, fares, and flights. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
    CITY AS CITYalias0, 
    CITY AS CITYalias1, 
    FARE AS FAREalias0, 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MINNEAPOLIS" AND 
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND 
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Aliases**: Tables are aliased for better readability.
2. **Joins**: We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` with `CITY` to get the airport codes for Kansas City and Minneapolis.
3. **Flight and Fare Information**: We ensure that we're pulling in data from the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to get corresponding fare costs.
4. **Round Trip Requirement**: The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that we only pull fares that are specifically for round trips.

Make sure to replace the placeholders for specific date/time or other conditions as required for your actual use case.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all round trip fares from ST. PETERSBURG to WASHINGTON, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = TRUE 
AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: Retrieves unique fare IDs and their round trip costs.
- **FROM**: Joins the relevant tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT` to link cities with their respective airports, flight information, and fares.
- **WHERE**: Filters results based on the cities ST. PETERSBURG and WASHINGTON, linking fares and ensuring that only round trip fares are selected.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To obtain the cost of a round trip flight from Denver to Pittsburgh, you will need to query the relevant tables to get the flight and fare information. Here's a SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Cheapest_Round_Trip_Cost
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
WHERE FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

### Explanation:
- This query starts by joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both Denver and Pittsburgh to find their respective airport codes.
- It then joins the `FLIGHT` table to get the flights between these two airports.
- The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is joined to get the associated fare for each flight.
- Finally, it filters for fares that are marked as round-trip required and retrieves the minimum round-trip cost.

This will give you the cost of the cheapest round trip flight from Denver to Pittsburgh.

To show round trip fares from San Jose to Salt Lake City, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares between San Francisco and Washington, you need to join relevant tables from the database schema. Here's the SQL query that can help you achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- **AIRPORT_SERVICE:** This is used to link each city (San Francisco and Washington) to their respective airport codes.
- **CITY:** This represents the city details, ensuring we are looking at the correct cities.
- **FARE:** Here, we're focusing on fares, particularly those that are round trips (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).
- **FLIGHT and FLIGHT_FARE:** These are utilized to connect flights to their respective fares.
- The query selects distinct pairs of fare IDs and their round trip costs for flights between the specified cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares for flights between Boston and Washington, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables to gather the necessary information.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
WHERE (CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE);
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **Tables Used**:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To find the airport codes for Boston and Washington.
  - `CITY`: To filter by city names (Boston and Washington).
  - `FLIGHT`: To find flights originating from Boston to Washington.
  - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To find the fares associated with those flights.
  - `FARE`: To get the fare details.

- **Conditions**:
  - The query ensures that we are looking specifically for flights from Boston to Washington and retrieves the fare information specifically for those flights, including both one-direction and round-trip costs.

Feel free to adjust this query based on your database structure or any additional criteria you may have!

Here’s the SQL query to retrieve all the one-way flights from Denver to Pittsburgh:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table for all flights departing from Denver and arriving in Pittsburgh, based on the information linked through the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables. It does not involve any round trip conditions, so it will return one-way flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Denver (DEN), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the airport codes for both cities.
   - `CITY` to match city names with their respective codes.
   - `FLIGHT` to fetch the flight details between the source and destination airports.

2. **WHERE Conditions**: 
   - It ensures that the city codes match the corresponding city names for Pittsburgh and Denver.
   - It uses these codes to find flights that depart from Pittsburgh and arrive in Denver.

This query will provide a list of one-way flights from Pittsburgh to Denver.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a one-way flight from Boston to San Francisco, we can use a SQL query that selects flights departing from the airport associated with Boston to the airport associated with San Francisco. Here's the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to identify the airport codes for both cities (Boston and San Francisco) and selects distinct flight IDs for flights that match the from and to airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all one-way flights from Ontario to Tacoma, you will need to join the relevant tables to ensure you have the correct airport codes and flights. The SQL query will look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the distinct flight IDs from the **FLIGHT** table.
- We are joining the **AIRPORT_SERVICE** table for both Ontario and Tacoma to get their respective airport codes.
- Finally, we ensure the flight is from the Ontario airport to the Tacoma airport using the **FROM_AIRPORT** and **TO_AIRPORT** fields.

This will give you all one-way flights from Ontario to Tacoma.

Question: show me the one way flights from DETROIT to WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get the one-way flights from Detroit to Westchester County, you would typically join the relevant tables to get the necessary information about flights, cities, and airports. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes that task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **From Clause**: This part specifies the tables involved in the query. We're using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get the airport codes for both Detroit and Westchester County.
- **Where Clause**: The conditions here ensure:
  - We are checking for the city names "DETROIT" and "WESTCHESTER COUNTY."
  - We are linking the appropriate airports with their respective cities.
  - We match the flights that leave from the airport in Detroit and arrive at the airport in Westchester County.
- **Distinct**: We include `DISTINCT` to ensure that we only get unique flight IDs and avoid duplicates.

This query will return the flight IDs for one-way flights from Detroit to Westchester County.

To retrieve one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando, you can use the following SQL query. This will identify flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Orlando without requiring a return segment:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This SQL statement joins the relevant tables to determine the one-way flights from Milwaukee (MIL) to Orlando (ORL). Make sure that the city names used in the query correspond to those available in the CITY table of your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To query all one-way flights between Boston and Philadelphia, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the appropriate airports for both Boston and Philadelphia.
- It ensures that the `FROM_AIRPORT` corresponds to Boston's airport code and the `TO_AIRPORT` corresponds to Philadelphia's airport code, thereby identifying one-way flights between the two cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a one-way flight from San Francisco to Dallas, you would structure your SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: The query uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get information about the airport codes for San Francisco and Dallas. 
- **CITY Table**: The `CITY` table provides the city names that match the given locations.
- **WHERE Clause**: The conditions filter for flights departing from San Francisco (identified by its airport code) to Dallas.
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: This ensures that only unique flight IDs are returned in case there are multiple entries for the same flight. 

This query will yield a list of all one-way flights from San Francisco to Dallas.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the one-way flights from Pittsburgh to Boston, you can use the following SQL query. This query will select the unique flight IDs for flights originating from the airport in Pittsburgh to the airport in Boston, utilizing the `AIRPORT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"

       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

### Explanation:
- This query fetches distinct flight IDs from `FLIGHT`.
- It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find the airport codes for the two cities involved (Pittsburgh and Boston).
- The flight selection criteria is based on those airport codes to ensure they are correctly matched for the one-way flight from Pittsburgh (`FROM_AIRPORT`) to Boston (`TO_AIRPORT`).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve available one-way tickets from Milwaukee to Orlando, you would need to join multiple tables to get the relevant flight information. Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID,
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FARE AS FAREalias0,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N';  -- This ensures we are only getting one-way fares
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs and one-way ticket costs for flights originating from Milwaukee and heading to Orlando.
- It joins the necessary tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` to get the correct mappings based on city names and fare conditions.
- The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'` checks that the flight is a one-way ticket.

Question: i want a one way ticket from DALLAS to BALTIMORE

Raw LLM Response:
To find a one-way ticket from Dallas to Baltimore, you'll want to identify the corresponding airports and then look for flights, ensuring to check the fare for one-direction costs. Here’s the SQL query to get the job done:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST IS NOT NULL;
```

In this query:

1. We connect `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to `CITY` to identify the airports corresponding to "DALLAS" and "BALTIMORE".
2. We use the `FLIGHT` table to find flights from Dallas to Baltimore.
3. We check the `FARE` table to ensure we select only those flights that have a valid one-direction cost. 

Adjust any parameters as needed based on additional filtering criteria such as flight days or times.

Raw LLM Response:
To show flights from Milwaukee to Orlando as a one-way trip, you can utilize a SQL query that joins the necessary tables, filtering based on the cities and ensuring it's a one-way flight (not focusing on fare details). Below is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs for one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando by checking the respective city codes and ensuring the flight details correspond to the stated airports.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Baltimore to Denver on United Airlines (UA) that offer first class service, we can leverage the relevant tables to check for flights while ensuring that we filter by the specific airline and class of service. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
      AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
      AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = 'FIRST' 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation of Query Components:
- **AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0** and **AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1**: These tables link cities to their respective airports for Baltimore and Denver.
- **CITYalias0** and **CITYalias1**: These ensure that we are filtering the correct city names.
- **FLIGHTalias0**: This is used to get the flights that depart from Baltimore and arrive at Denver.
- **FLIGHT_FAREalias0** and **FAREalias0**: These tables allow us to check the fare structure for the flights to ensure they include first class.
- **FARE_BASISalias0**: This table has the class type information which we check for 'FIRST'.

This query will return the list of flights that fulfill all the specified conditions.

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins multiple tables to filter the flights based on the source and destination cities (Denver and Baltimore) as well as to ensure the airline code is 'UA' and the class type is 'FIRST'.
- The conditions in the `WHERE` clause ensure that only relevant flights are selected.

      AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins necessary tables to connect cities to their associated airports.
- Filters for flights from Denver to Baltimore operated by United Airlines (UA) that offer FIRST class service by checking the relevant class type in the `FARE_BASIS` table.
- Selects distinct flight IDs as the result.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the COACH class flights on the airline "TW" (assumed to be the airline code for Trans World Airlines) from COLUMBUS to ST. PAUL, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "COLUMBUS"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "TW"
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
      AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "COACH"
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. The query starts by selecting distinct flight IDs.
2. It joins the necessary tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the relevant airports for the cities, `CITY` to identify the correct cities, `FLIGHT` to get flight details, and `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` to filter by fare class.
3. The `WHERE` clause specifies that we only want flights from COLUMBUS to ST. PAUL, specifically operated by airline "TW", and with a fare class of "COACH".

SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about an American Airlines (AA) flight in First Class from Philadelphia to Dallas, we need to join multiple tables, including those that contain information about the flights, fare classes, and relevant airports. Assuming we are looking specifically for First Class flights, we should filter for the appropriate booking class.

Here is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST";
```

### Explanation:
- `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: Used to find the airport codes for Philadelphia and Dallas.
- `CITY`: Provides names of the cities for the airport service joins.
- `FLIGHT`: This table contains the flight details and is joined based on the originating and destination airport codes.
- `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE`: Are used to check the fare details to ensure it includes First Class service.
- The query filters for flights that are specific to AA (American Airlines) and First Class service. 

Make sure to replace any placeholder values (if necessary) with actual dates, specific parameters, or criteria based on your application needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve FIRST class flights operated by American Airlines (AA) between Dallas and Philadelphia, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins various tables to find all distinct flights departing from the airport related to Dallas and arriving at the airport for Philadelphia.
- It filters for flights with "FIRST" class service and operated by American Airlines (designated by "AA").

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if United Airlines (UA) provides any FIRST class flights from Denver to Baltimore, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = 'FIRST';
```

This query performs the following:
1. Joins the `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to get flights operated by United Airlines (UA).
2. Joins the `CITY` table to get the cities corresponding to the departure (Denver) and arrival (Baltimore) airports.
3. Checks if the flight has a FARE_BASIS with a class type of 'FIRST'.
4. Selects distinct flight IDs. 

Make sure that the field names and logical relationships are accurate according to your database schema. Adjust any necessary identifiers based on actual data types and constraints.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Newark, New Jersey to Cleveland, Ohio, you can use the following SQL query. This query will find the relevant airport codes for the specified cities and then get the flight details based on those airport codes.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
       CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND 
       AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.STATE_CODE = "NJ" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
       CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND 
       AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.STATE_CODE = "OH" AND 
       FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
       FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

This query performs the following actions:
1. Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the airport codes for Newark and Cleveland based on their respective city names.
2. Joins the `CITY` table to ensure the correct city names and state codes are being used.
3. Filters the flights based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns in the `FLIGHT` table to get flights leaving from Newark and arriving in Cleveland.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Ontario, California to Orlando, Florida, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.STATE_CODE = "CALIFORNIA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.STATE_CODE = "FLORIDA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the correct airport codes for Ontario (California) and Orlando (Florida).
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to match city names and states, ensuring that you're only retrieving flights that depart from Ontario, California to Orlando, Florida. 

Make sure to replace any necessary state code filters or other conditions, if needed, based on your database setup.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the flights from LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA to MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, you would need to query the relevant tables to match the source and destination cities. Here's how the SQL statement would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LONG BEACH" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: We're pulling data from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice (once for LONG BEACH and once for MEMPHIS) to find the corresponding airport codes.
- **INNER JOIN**: The cities are linked to their respective airport services to confirm they match the cities in question.
- **WHERE Clause**: We set conditions to ensure that we're only fetching flights from LONG BEACH to MEMPHIS.
- **DISTINCT**: This is used to avoid duplicate flight entries.
- **SELECT**: We're focusing on the unique flight IDs that meet the criteria specified.

This query assumes that the data for LONG BEACH and MEMPHIS exists in your database under the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables. Adjust field names as necessary based on your actual schema details.

Question: morning flights out of SAN FRANCISCO arriving BOSTON afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get morning flights out of San Francisco arriving in Boston in the afternoon, you can leverage the following SQL query. This will look for flights departing from the San Francisco airport and arriving at the Boston airport within a specified time range to define morning and afternoon.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '06:00:00' -- Start of morning
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00' -- End of morning
  AND (FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '12:00:00' AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00'); -- Afternoon
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: The query incorporates multiple tables to get relevant information about flights departing from San Francisco to Boston.
- **City Conditions**: It checks whether the departing city is San Francisco and the arriving city is Boston.
- **Time Conditions**: It filters flights departing in the morning (between 06:00 AM and 12:00 PM) and arriving in the afternoon (between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM).
- **DISTINCT**: This ensures that only unique flight IDs are returned in case there are multiple records for the same flight.

Make sure to adjust the time format according to your database setup, as time formats may vary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Boston to Atlanta that leaves in the afternoon (after 12:00 PM) and arrives close to 5 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter the airports associated with Boston and Atlanta.
2. **Departure and Arrival Conditions**: It checks that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is after 12:00 PM and that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is within the window of 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
3. **SELECT DISTINCT**: This ensures that only unique flight IDs are returned. 

Make sure the format of your time in the database matches what is being queried (`'HH:mm:ss'`). Adjust it if necessary based on your schema's time formatting.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Dallas to San Francisco that leave in the morning and arrive in the morning, you can structure your SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '06:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '06:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation of Query Components:
- The `SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID` selects unique flight IDs.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to map city names to their respective airport codes.
- `WHERE` conditions ensure that:
  - The departing city is "DALLAS".
  - The destination city is "SAN FRANCISCO".
  - The `DEPARTURE_TIME` is between 6 AM and 12 PM (inclusive).
  - The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is also between 6 AM and 12 PM (inclusive).

Adjust the time format if needed based on your database's time format (e.g., 24-hour or 12-hour clock).

Question: show me the flight that leaves PHILADELPHIA in the afternoon and arrives in the evening in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight that leaves Philadelphia in the afternoon and arrives in the evening in Denver, you need to specify the appropriate time ranges for both departure and arrival. Assuming "afternoon" is between 12:00 PM and before 6:00 PM, and "evening" is between 6:00 PM and before 12:00 AM (midnight), the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '18:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '18:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '23:59:59';
```

This SQL query performs the following actions:
- Joins the relevant tables to link the airport services for both Philadelphia and Denver.
- Filters the flights that depart from Philadelphia between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM and arrive in Denver between 6:00 PM and 11:59 PM.
- Selects distinct flight IDs to ensure there are no duplicate results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO that leave in the afternoon and arrive in the evening, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that departure times in the afternoon are between 12:00 PM (1200) and 5:59 PM (1759) and that arrival times in the evening are between 6:00 PM (1800) and 11:59 PM (2359).

```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both Boston and San Francisco to link cities with their respective airport codes.
2. **City Filter**: It filters for the specific cities of Boston and San Francisco.
3. **Departure and Arrival Time Filters**: The query filters flights that depart in the afternoon (between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM) and arrive in the evening (between 6:00 PM and 11:59 PM).
4. **Distinct Flights**: It selects distinct flight IDs to avoid duplicates in the output.

Question: is there a flight in the afternoon from PHILADELPHIA that arrives in the evening in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check for flights that leave PHILADELPHIA in the afternoon and arrive in DENVER in the evening, you need to filter for the appropriate departure and arrival times. Generally, the afternoon can be considered as flights departing between 12:00 PM (1200 hours) and 5:59 PM (1759 hours), while the evening is often considered as flights arriving between 5:00 PM (1700 hours) and 11:59 PM (2359 hours). 

Here’s how you can structure the SQL query for this scenario:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '1200' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '1800'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '1700'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '2400';
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables.
- The first `AIRPORT_SERVICE` alias (`AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`) corresponds to PHILADELPHIA.
- The second `AIRPORT_SERVICE` alias (`AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`) corresponds to DENVER.
- We're filtering flights that depart in the afternoon and arrive in the evening as specified.

     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: i want a flight from SAN FRANCISCO to DENVER leaving SAN FRANCISCO in the afternoon arriving DENVER around 5 in the afternoon
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from SAN FRANCISCO to DENVER that departs in the afternoon (which we can consider as after 12:00 PM) and arrives in DENVER around 5:00 PM, we can construct the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clauses**: We are joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` on `CITY` to relate SAN FRANCISCO to its airport and similarly for DENVER.
2. **WHERE Clauses**:
   - We filter to ensure that the source city is SAN FRANCISCO and the destination city is DENVER.
   - We check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is after or equal to 12:00 PM.
   - We check that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is between 5:00 PM and 5:59 PM, ensuring it arrives around that time.
3. **SELECT Distinct**: We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we only get unique flight IDs.

This query should provide the required flights based on the specified conditions.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), you'll want to select the minimum departure time from the relevant tables. The following SQL query achieves this:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" /* Assuming BWI corresponds to Baltimore */
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Joins the relevant tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`) to gather necessary information about the flights between BWI (BALTIMORE) and BOS (BOSTON).
2. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the cities and ensures the flights are between the correct airports.
3. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order, ensuring that the earliest flight comes first.
4. **LIMIT 1**: Limits the result to the earliest flight only. 

This query assumes that you can directly relate BWI to "BALTIMORE" and BOS to "BOSTON" in the `CITY` table. If you need to confirm airport codes, you would need to join with the `AIRPORT` table as well.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight between Boston (BOS) and Baltimore/Washington International (BWI), you can use the following SQL query. This query selects distinct flight identifiers and orders the results by the departure time, limiting the output to the earliest flight:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

           FROM FARE_BASIS 
           WHERE CLASS_TYPE = "COACH");
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The query selects distinct round trip and one-way costs from the `FARE` table for flights that match the specified conditions.
- It checks that the departure city is NEWARK and the destination is LOS ANGELES using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
- The `FLIGHT` table is linked to the `FARE` table through the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the costs associated with those flights.
- It ensures that only flights departing after 1500 (3 PM) are considered.
- Finally, it restricts the results to only those with a fare basis code that corresponds to the COACH class type by using a subquery.

Question: what NW flights stop in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the Northwest Airlines (NW) flights that stop in Denver, you can use a SQL query that connects relevant tables such as FLIGHT, FLIGHT_STOP, and AIRPORT_SERVICE. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW' 
AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT:** The main table containing flight information.
- **FLIGHT_STOP:** Joined on the flight ID to get the stop details.
- **AIRPORT:** Joined to identify the airport name corresponding to the stop airports.
- The `WHERE` clause checks that the airline code is 'NW' (for Northwest Airlines) and that the airport name is 'DENVER'. 

This query will return a list of distinct flight IDs for NW flights that stop in Denver.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW' 
AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';

Question: what UA flights go through DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find United Airlines (UA) flights that go through Denver, you can query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights operated by United Airlines (where `AIRLINE_CODE` is "UA") and that have either the origin or the destination as Denver (which can be linked to `AIRPORT_SERVICE` based on the city code). Here is a possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
  AND (CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' OR CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER');
```

This query does the following:
- It selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID`s from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to correlate each flight's departure and arrival airports to their respective cities.
- It checks if either the departure city (`CITYalias0`) or arrival city (`CITYalias1`) is Denver.
- It filters the results to include only flights from United Airlines (with `AIRLINE_CODE` 'UA').

Raw LLM Response:
To query for all UA (United Airlines) flights that go through Denver, you'll need to find flights that either depart from or arrive at the airport code corresponding to Denver. This can be done by looking for flights where the `FROM_AIRPORT` or `TO_AIRPORT` is the Denver airport code, while also filtering by the `AIRLINE_CODE` for UA.

First, we need to retrieve the airport code for Denver from the `AIRPORT` table. Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'
AND (FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
));
```

In this query:

1. We're selecting distinct flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
2. We're filtering for flights where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'UA'.
3. We check if the flight either departs from or arrives at the Denver airport by using subqueries to obtain the airport code for Denver.

Make sure to adjust the airport name in the subqueries to match the exact naming in your database if necessary.

WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'
AND (FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
));

Question: all NW flights with stopovers in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get all Northwest (NW) flights with stopovers in Denver, you will need to join the relevant tables to filter for flights operated by Northwest Airlines (indicated by the airline code "NW") and having Denver as one of the stopover airports. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'
AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:

1. **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0** - This selects the main flight information.
2. **JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0** - Joins the flight stop information based on the `FLIGHT_ID`.
3. **JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0** - Joins the airport service to find details about the stop airport.
4. **JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0** - Joins the city table to filter by the city name.
5. **WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'** - Filters the results for flights operated by Northwest Airlines.
6. **AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER'** - Filters the stopover city to be Denver.

This query will return a list of flight IDs for Northwest Airlines flights that have a stopover in Denver.

```

### Explanation:
- We select distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table where the airline code is "UA" (for United Airlines).
- We check the `FLIGHT_STOP` table for any stopovers associated with these flights, specifically looking for stop airports that match "DENVER".
- The subquery retrieves the airport code corresponding to the city name "DENVER" from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.

Question: what NW flights stop in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Northwest Airlines (NW) flights that stop in Denver (DEN), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 
    ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" 
AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = "DEN";
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0**: We are selecting flights from the FLIGHT table.
2. **JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This joins the FLIGHT table with the FLIGHT_STOP table based on matching FLIGHT_IDs to identify the stops for each flight.
3. **WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW"**: This filters the flights to only include those operated by Northwest Airlines.
4. **AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = "DEN"**: This further filters the results to include only flights that have a stop at Denver's airport (DEN). 

Make sure to execute this query against a database containing the appropriate dataset to get the results.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 
    ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" 
AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = "DEN";

Question: NW flights with stops in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights operated by airline "NW" that have stops in Denver, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 
    ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW' 
    AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER');
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table, filtering for those where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is "NW".
- It joins the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to find flights that have stops, ensuring that at least one of those stops is in Denver.
- The `STOP_AIRPORT` is checked against a subquery that retrieves the `AIRPORT_CODE` for Denver from the `AIRPORT` table, ensuring the correct airport code is used.

Question: which UA flights go through DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the United Airlines (UA) flights that go through Denver, you would typically look for flights originating from an airport (or several airports) and arriving at Denver, or flights that have Denver as a leg in their routing. Here is how the SQL query could be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" 
      AND (AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "DENVER") 
           OR AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "DENVER"));
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selection of Flights**: The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to get unique flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table (`FLIGHTalias0`).
   
2. **Joins with Airport Services**: The `JOIN` clauses help link the flights to their corresponding origin and destination airport services.

3. **Airline Filter**: The condition `FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA"` filters to only include flights operated by United Airlines.

4. **Denver Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause checks if either the departure or destination is for an airport linked to the city of Denver. The subqueries get the `CITY_CODE` corresponding to "DENVER".

This query will provide a list of flights labeled with `FLIGHT_ID` that are carried out by United Airlines and either depart from or arrive at Denver.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" 
      AND (AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "DENVER") 
           OR AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "DENVER"));

Question: UA stopping in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights operated by United Airlines (UA) that stop in Denver, you would need to look for flights where either the departure or arrival airport is Denver, and the airline code corresponds to UA. Here’s how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" 
AND (FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER") 
     OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER"));
```

In this query:
- We select distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is "UA".
- We check if either the `FROM_AIRPORT` or `TO_AIRPORT` is Denver by sub-querying the `AIRPORT` table to get the correct airport code for Denver. 

This will give you the list of all flights operated by United Airlines that have a stop in Denver.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" 
AND (FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER") 
     OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER"));

Question: UA flights stopping in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve UA (United Airlines) flights that stop in Denver, you can write a SQL query that joins the relevant tables and filters based on the airline code for United Airlines. The following SQL query accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
  AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
  );
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is aliased as `FLIGHTalias0`, which represents the flights.
- We're joining the `FLIGHT_STOP` table (aliased as `FLIGHT_STOPalias0`) to find the corresponding stop information for each flight.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'` ensures we're only selecting flights from United Airlines.
- The subquery `SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'` retrieves the airport code for Denver, which can be used to filter the `STOP_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT_STOP` table.
- The result will be distinct flight IDs for UA flights that include a stop in Denver.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights operated by Delta Airlines (DL) that pass through Atlanta, you need to join the relevant tables to filter the flights based on the airline code and the airport code for Atlanta. Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
   OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
  AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We're joining the `FLIGHT` table on the `AIRPORT` table using the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns to find flights that either depart from or arrive at Atlanta.
- We're filtering the results where the `AIRLINE_CODE` matches 'DL' (Delta Airlines) and the airport name is 'ATLANTA'. 

This query ensures that you get all flights operated by Delta that are connected to Atlanta.

Raw LLM Response:
To identify the type of aircraft used for the EA flight 825 flying from Atlanta to Denver leaving at 5:55 AM, you would need to join several tables to retrieve the relevant information about the flight and its corresponding aircraft details. Here's the SQL query you can use for this purpose:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AC.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, AC.MANUFACTURER, AC.BASIC_TYPE
FROM FLIGHT AS F
JOIN AIRPORT AS A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS ES ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS AC ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AC.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE A1.AIRPORT_NAME = "ATLANTA"
  AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = "825"  -- Assuming EA's flight number format.
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME = "05:55:00"
  AND F.AIRLINE_CODE = "EA";  -- Assuming the airline's code for EA.
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **FROM CLASSES**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is the starting point since we need to identify the specific flight.
   - The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice to find out the detailed information for both the departure airport (Atlanta) and the arrival airport (Denver).
   - The `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` table connects the flight with its specific aircraft.
   - The `AIRCRAFT` table contains the detailed information about the aircraft, such as its description, manufacturer, and type.

2. **WHERE CLAUSE**: 
   - The query filters for flights departing from Atlanta to Denver.
   - It matches the specified flight number and departure time.
   - The airline code is included to obtain the flight operated by the specific airline (EA).

Make sure to replace `"EA"` with the actual airline code if it differs from what's expected.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the type of aircraft used for EA flight 825 from Atlanta to Denver leaving at 5:55, you will need to join the relevant tables that contain information about flights, aircraft, and the departure details. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRCRAFT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE 
JOIN AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "EA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 825 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "ATLANTA") 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER") 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = "05:55";
```

In this query:
- `FLIGHT` table is used to get flight details.
- `AIRCRAFT_SEQUENCE` table is assumed to link to `AIRCRAFT` table to determine the aircraft type.
- The `AIRPORT` table is used to ensure the correct departure and arrival airports by matching their names.
- The departure time is filtered to match 5:55. 

Make sure to adjust any specific column names or table names based on the actual database schema you are using if they differ from the provided schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine the type of aircraft used for the flight EA 825 flying from ATLANTA to DENVER, when it departs at 5:55 AM, you need to join the relevant tables to get the information about the flight and the associated aircraft. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE 
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = "825" 
  AND AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "EA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "ATLANTA") 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER") 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '05:55:00';
```

This query does the following:
1. Selects the description of the aircraft.
2. Joins the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE`, and `AIRCRAFT` tables to access the appropriate fields.

Question: what flights leave SEATTLE on sunday on CO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights leaving SEATTLE on Sunday operated by Continental Airlines (CO), we will use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE' 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO';
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:

- **FROM Clause**: The query is selecting from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to gather all necessary data.
  
- **WHERE Clause**:
    - It first filters for cities called "SEATTLE" to find the corresponding city code.
    - It checks that the `FROM_AIRPORT` in `FLIGHT` matches the `AIRPORT_CODE` for SEATTLE airport from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`.
    - It ensures that the flight day (from `FLIGHT`) matches the code for "SUNDAY" from the `DAYS` table.
    - Finally, it filters for flights whose `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'CO', indicating Continental Airlines.

This query retrieves the unique flight IDs for flights operated by Continental Airlines (CO) leaving SEATTLE on Sundays.

Question: list all flights leaving DENVER on CO on sunday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights leaving Denver on Continental Airlines (CO) on Sundays, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0 
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY";
```

This query does the following:

1. Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find the airport code for Denver.
2. Joins the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flights originating from Denver.
3. Filters by the airline code "CO" for Continental Airlines.
4. Filters by the day of the week to only include flights on Sunday.

Make sure you have the correct names and structures as per your database schema. Adjust as necessary.

JOIN AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA";
```

This query retrieves all distinct flights from Denver to Atlanta along with their corresponding fares. It joins multiple tables to connect the flights, airports, cities, and fare details. Make sure that the table names and attributes match the actual database schema you are using.

Raw LLM Response:
To get all flights and fares from Dallas to San Francisco, you can join the appropriate tables that contain the relevant information about flights, airports, services, and fares. Here's the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    FARE.FARE_ID, 
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_DALLAS,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_SAN_FRANCISCO,
    CITY AS CITY_DALLAS,
    CITY AS CITY_SAN_FRANCISCO,
    FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT_FARE,
    FARE
WHERE 
    CITY_DALLAS.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' AND 
    CITY_SAN_FRANCISCO.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' AND
    AS_DALLAS.CITY_CODE = CITY_DALLAS.CITY_CODE AND 
    AS_SAN_FRANCISCO.CITY_CODE = CITY_SAN_FRANCISCO.CITY_CODE AND
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AS_DALLAS.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AS_SAN_FRANCISCO.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT_FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID AND 
    FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The query begins by selecting distinct flight and fare details.
- It uses `AIRPORT_SERVICE` twice to represent the services available at Dallas and San Francisco airports.
- It joins on the `CITY` table to ensure that we have the correct city codes.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined to get flight details from Dallas to San Francisco.
- The `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables are joined to obtain the fare details associated with each flight.
- We apply filtering conditions to ensure the flights are specifically from Dallas to San Francisco. 

Make sure to replace any placeholder field or variable names as appropriate based on your application or the specific data you're working with.

Question: flights from KANSAS CITY to CLEVELAND and price
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Kansas City to Cleveland along with their prices, you can join the relevant tables in your database schema. You would typically join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for airport locations, the `FLIGHT` table for flight details, and the `FARE` table for pricing information.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
    CITY AS CITYalias0, 
    CITY AS CITYalias1, 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0, 
    FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND 
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND 
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used**:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the airport codes for Kansas City and Cleveland.
  - `CITY` to filter based on city names.
  - `FLIGHT` to retrieve flight details from Kansas City to Cleveland.
  - `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get the pricing information related to those flights.

- **Columns Retrieved**:
  - `FLIGHT_ID` and `FLIGHT_NUMBER` from the `FLIGHT` table.
  - `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table to list the prices.

Make sure that the cities "KANSAS CITY" and "CLEVELAND" exist in the database to return the relevant flights and their prices.

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain flights from Denver to Philadelphia along with their associated fares, you can join the relevant tables to access both flight information and fare details. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME,

    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT**: This clause is used to get unique flights matching the query criteria.
2. **FROM Clause**: Involves multiple tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` to retrieve the necessary information.
3. **WHERE Clause**: This clause filters the results to the specified cities (Denver and Philadelphia) and connects the respective airport services and flights.
4. **Column Selection**: We're selecting various flight identifiers, along with fare details (one-way and round-trip costs).

Running this query will provide a list of flights that operate between Denver and Philadelphia, including their associated fare details.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares and flights from Baltimore to Philadelphia, you would need to join the relevant tables to extract the necessary information. Below is an appropriate SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1, FARE AS FAREalias0, FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
       AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To match airports with their respective cities.
   - `CITY`: To identify Baltimore and Philadelphia.
   - `FLIGHT`: To list flights between the two airports.
   - `FARE`: To retrieve fare details for those flights.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To link flights with their corresponding fares.

2. **Join Conditions**:
   - You join the `CITY` table with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the respective airport codes for Baltimore and Philadelphia.
   - You then match those airport codes to identify available flights.
   - Finally, you join the `FLIGHT` table with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to retrieve fare details for those flights.

3. **Result Fields**:
   - The query gathers the unique `FLIGHT_ID` for flights from Baltimore to Philadelphia along with their one-way and round-trip fares. 

Make sure that the city names in the database are correctly spelled and formatted, as SQL is case-sensitive depending on the configured settings.

Raw LLM Response:
To show all flights from ATLANTA to WASHINGTON along with their prices, you can construct the following SQL query. This will include the necessary tables to link the flights, airports, and fares.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 
  ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 
  ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 
  ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
  ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
  ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 
  ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **Extracting DISTINCT FLIGHT IDs**: The query selects unique flight IDs.
- **Joining Tables**: It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for ATLANTA and WASHINGTON using the relevant `CITY` entries.
- **Including Flight Details**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined to include flights that depart from ATLANTA and arrive in WASHINGTON.
- **Adding Pricing Information**: Finally, it joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to bring in pricing information for the flights. 

Make sure to adjust for the exact structure of your schema if necessary!

Question: show me all flights with fares from PITTSBURGH to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights with fares from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, we need to write a query that joins the relevant tables to get the flight information and the associated fares. Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

This SQL query does the following:
1. Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the airports associated with Pittsburgh and San Francisco.
2. Joins the `CITY` table to ensure that the right city names are used for the airports.
3. Joins the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flight information between the two specified airports.
4. Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to include fare information for the flights retrieved.

With this query, you will get a list of all unique flight IDs that have fares associated with flights departing from Pittsburgh and arriving in San Francisco.

Raw LLM Response:
To get a list of all the flights between Dallas and Baltimore along with their cost, you can use the following SQL query. This will involve joining several tables to retrieve the flight details and corresponding fares:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    AIRPORTSERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AS FROM_AIRPORT_CODE,
    AIRPORTSERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AS TO_AIRPORT_CODE
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORTSERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORTSERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FARE AS FAREalias0,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORTSERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORTSERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTSERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTSERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves flight IDs, flight numbers, and costing information (both round trip and one-direction costs).
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT` tables to correlate cities (Dallas and Baltimore) to flights and their respective costs.
- Note that you'll want to ensure that the "DALLAS" and "BALTIMORE" names exactly match how they are recorded in your database, as SQL queries are often case-sensitive.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights and their associated fares from DENVER to SAN FRANCISCO, you will need to join the relevant tables based on the specified conditions for the departure and destination airports. The following SQL query does this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FARE AS FAREalias0,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs, flight numbers, airline codes, and the one-direction and round trip costs from the specified tables.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both departure (DENVER) and arrival (SAN FRANCISCO) cities with the corresponding `CITY` table to get the relevant airport codes.
- It also joins the `FARE` table through the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the fare details associated with each flight.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that the results are filtered to include only flights departing from DENVER to SAN FRANCISCO.

    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Alias**: The tables have been aliased to simplify referencing them later in the query.
2. **City and Airport Filtering**: The query filters for records where the city is Boston for the departure airport and Philadelphia for the arrival airport.
3. **Join Conditions**: It connects the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for Boston and Philadelphia to ensure we only get flights between those two cities. It also connects to the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare information associated with those flights.
4. **Selecting Relevant Fields**: It selects distinct flight IDs along with their one-way and round-trip costs as the output.

This SQL query should give you the desired output of flights and their fares from Boston to Philadelphia.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares and flights from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, you would need to join the relevant tables that contain information about the flights, fares, and the airports associated with the specified cities. Here’s an SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID,
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID,
    FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FARE AS FAREalias0,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND
    FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To get the airports for Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
   - `CITY`: To filter the cities by their names.
   - `FLIGHT`: To retrieve flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To associate flights with their corresponding fares.
   - `FARE`: To get fare details.

2. **`WHERE` Clause**: 
   - Filters for the specific cities (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia).
   - Ensures that the flights are from the correct airport services (determined by the cities).

3. **`SELECT DISTINCT`**: 
   - Fetches unique flight IDs along with fare details, airline codes, flight numbers, and departure and arrival times.

Modify the query as necessary to fit specific requirements or to retrieve additional information.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the type of aircraft used on the first class American Airlines (AA) flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco with a stopover in Dallas, the SQL query will need to join several tables including those that store flight information, fare information, and aircraft details.

Here's how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN AIRCRAFT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA"))
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"))
AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"))
AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST'
AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Joined**:
   - `FLIGHT`: Holds the basic flight information.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: Links flights to fares.
   - `FARE`: Contains fare details.
   - `FARE_BASIS`: Contains information about booking classes, including "FIRST".
   - `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE`: Links flights to the specific aircraft used.
   - `AIRCRAFT`: Stores details about the aircraft.
   - `FLIGHT_STOP`: Contains stopover information for flights.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` is determined using a subquery to match against Philadelphia's airport code.
   - The `TO_AIRPORT` is matched similarly against San Francisco.
   - The stopover airport code for Dallas is retrieved in a nested subquery.
   - The booking class must be "FIRST".
   - The airline code must be AA for American Airlines.

This SQL query will return the description of the aircraft used for the specified flight route and conditions. Adjustments may be needed based on the exact structure of the database and any additional constraints or columns not mentioned here.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the kind of aircraft used on the FIRST class flight operated by American Airlines (AA) from Philadelphia to San Francisco, with a stop in Dallas, you would need to join multiple tables. Specifically, you'll need to access flights, the corresponding fare information to determine if a flight is classified as FIRST class, and information about the aircraft used. Here’s how the SQL query can be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA'))
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'))
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
    SELECT FLIGHT_ID 
    FROM FLIGHT_STOP 
    WHERE STOP_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS'))
)
AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = 'FIRST';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **Selecting Aircraft Description**: We want the description of the aircraft, so we select `AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION`.
- **Joining Necessary Tables**: We join several tables to bring in relevant information:
  - The `FLIGHT` table provides details about flight numbers, airlines, and more.
  - The `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables help us determine if the flight offers FIRST class service.
  - The `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` and `AIRCRAFT` tables provide details about the aircraft used for the flight.
- **Filtering Conditions**:
  - Ensure the airline is American Airlines (`'AA'`).
  - Check that the `FROM_AIRPORT` is for Philadelphia and `TO_AIRPORT` is for San Francisco.
  - Ensure that there is a stop in Dallas by checking the `FLIGHT_STOP` table.
  - Finally, confirm the class type is FIRST.

This query should return the aircraft used for the specified flight, ensuring all conditions are met.

Question: what is the earliest departure time from BOSTON to DENVER
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest departure time from Boston to Denver, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves the minimum departure time from flights leaving Boston (from the appropriate airport code) to Denver (to the appropriate airport code) while considering the available connections through the airport services:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS EARLIEST_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both Boston and Denver to get their corresponding airport codes.
- Joins the `CITY` table to filter by city names.
- Filters the flights that depart from Boston and arrive in Denver.
- Finally, it uses the `MIN` function to get the earliest departure time from the result set.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Washington to Philadelphia, you would want to query the relevant tables to retrieve the flight details for flights departing from the airport in Washington to the airport in Philadelphia, then order those results by the departure time to find the earliest one. Here's a suitable SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs and their departure times from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to identify the correct airports for "WASHINGTON" and "PHILADELPHIA".
- It filters the flights based on their origin and destination airports.
- The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order, and the `LIMIT 1` ensures only the earliest flight is retrieved.

To find the earliest flight that departs from ATLANTA to DENVER, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS EARLIEST_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the necessary airport codes for the cities of Boston and Denver.
  
2. **Filter Flights**: It filters the flights that depart from Boston and arrive in Denver.

3. **Order By Departure Time**: The results are ordered by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to find the earliest flight.

4. **Limit Result**: The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the earliest flight is returned.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the first flight leaving from Oakland to Boston, we need to query the relevant tables to get the departure time of flights from Oakland to Boston and then find the minimum (earliest) departure time.

Here's the SQL query that would accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
          SELECT MIN(FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME)
          FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
          WHERE FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
          AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      );
```

### Explanation:
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with `CITY` to identify the airport codes for Oakland and Boston.
- We then join the `FLIGHT` table to get the relevant flights from Oakland to Boston.
- We use a subquery to find the minimum departure time from Oakland to Boston, ensuring we only retrieve the flight(s) that have that minimum departure time.

Question: show me city served both by NX and CP

Raw LLM Response:
To find cities that are served by both NX (Airline Code for one airline) and CP (Airline Code for another airline), you can follow a query that joins the `AIRLINE` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables. Here is how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NX'
AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE IN (
    SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1
    JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
    JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 ON FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE FLIGHTalias1.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CP'
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Cities**: The main query selects distinct city names.
2. **Join Operations**: It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to correlate the city with flights.
3. **Filtering by Airlines**: 
   - The main query checks for flights from airline 'NX', while the subquery checks for cities served by airline 'CP'.
   - The subquery returns cities that have flights from 'CP', which are then checked against the output from the main query to ensure only cities served by both airlines are selected.

This query structure allows you to gather information effectively while filtering based on the criteria provided.

Question: how many airlines have flights with service class YN
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ) FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "YN" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many airlines have flights with a service class specified by the code "YN," you can use the following SQL query. This will count the distinct airlines that offer flights with the specified service class:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE) AS AIRLINE_COUNT
FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = 'YN';
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to correlate airline information with the corresponding flights and their fare details.
- Filters the results to include only those fares where the `BOOKING_CLASS` matches "YN."
- Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to determine the number of unique airlines offering flights with the specified service class.

Raw LLM Response:
To find available flights leaving from Oakland, California on Tuesday and arriving in Philadelphia on Wednesday, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME > FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME; -- Ensure the arrival time is on the following day
```

Make sure to replace `day_number_tuesday`, `month_number`, and `year_value` with the actual values representing Tuesday's date. 

### Explanation:
1. **JOINs**: It uses joins between `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the airport codes for Oakland and Philadelphia.
2. **DAY Filter**: It checks if the flight corresponds to Tuesday's day name.
3. **Departure and Arrival**: It ensures that the flight departs on Tuesday and arrives on Wednesday by filtering based on the departure and arrival times.

You can adjust the details of the date and arrival criteria according to your specific needs.

Question: of all airlines which airline has the most arrivals in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE GROUP BY FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the airline with the most arrivals in Atlanta, you would need to join the relevant tables: `FLIGHT` to get the flights, `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to link the flights to the airports, `CITY` to specify Atlanta, and `AIRLINE` to specify the airlines. 

Here’s how you can construct the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME, COUNT(FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
GROUP BY AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME
ORDER BY ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME` selects the name of the airline.
- `COUNT(FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT` counts the number of arrivals for each airline.
- The `JOIN` operations connect the flights with the airport service and the city to filter flights that arrive in Atlanta.
- The `WHERE` clause restricts the results to only those flights that arrive in Atlanta.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by airline name.
- The `ORDER BY ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC` orders the airlines by the count of arrivals in descending order.
- `LIMIT 1` restricts the output to the airline with the most arrivals. 

This query will give you the airline with the highest number of arrivals in Atlanta.

Question: which airline has the most arrivals in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE GROUP BY FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the airline with the most arrivals in Atlanta, you'd typically need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table and filter for flights arriving at the relevant airport code for Atlanta. You would also group the results by airline and count the arrivals, then order the results by that count in descending order. Here's how you might write an SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME, 
    COUNT(FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT 
FROM 
    FLIGHT 
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE 
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA')
GROUP BY 
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME 
ORDER BY 
    ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC 
LIMIT 1;  -- optional: limit to get the airline with the most arrivals only
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM FLIGHT JOIN AIRLINE**: This joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table based on the `AIRLINE_CODE`.
2. **WHERE FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT IN**: This filters the flights to only those that are arriving at the airport codes corresponding to Atlanta.
3. **GROUP BY AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME**: This groups the results by each airline.
4. **COUNT(FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT**: This counts how many flights each airline has arriving, which we'll alias as `ARRIVAL_COUNT`.
5. **ORDER BY ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC LIMIT 1**: This orders the results in descending order so that the airline with the most arrivals is at the top, and `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top entry is returned.

Make sure to confirm the airport code for Atlanta as there can be multiple airports in the area (e.g. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is commonly used with the code ATL). Adjust the airport name in the subquery accordingly if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if UNITED Airlines flies from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth, you can write a SQL query that checks for flights with the specified airline, source city, and destination city. Here's how the SQL might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_NAME = "UNITED"
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS FORT WORTH"
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the necessary tables to get the relationships between airlines, airport services, and cities.
- It filters for flights that are operated by "UNITED" Airlines, departing from Boston and arriving in Dallas Fort Worth, ensuring all relevant city and airport connections are made.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS to SAN FRANCISCO on Monday, July 8th, we first need to ensure we have the appropriate tables and conditions for the required route and date. This involves using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for city information, the `DATE_DAY` table to get the correct date, and the `FLIGHT` table to look for the specific flights along the specified route.

Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT1.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias2, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT2 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND 
    CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND 
    CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND 
    FLIGHT1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT2.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT2.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
    DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 8 AND 
    DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 7 AND 
    DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = <specific_year> AND 
    DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND 
    FLIGHT1.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND 
    FLIGHT2.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

**Note:** 
1. Replace `<specific_year>` with the actual year you are referring to (for example, if the year is 2023, just replace it with `2023`).
2. This query retrieves the distinct flight IDs for a two-leg flight journey starting in PHILADELPHIA, connecting in DALLAS, and ending in SAN FRANCISCO on the specified date, considering that both legs of the flight occur on the same day.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Columbus to Houston with a stopover in Nashville for tomorrow, you would need to reference the relevant tables for flights, airports, cities, and potentially the flight stop information. Here is an example SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias2,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "COLUMBUS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON"
  AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for tomorrow's date.
- The query joins the necessary tables to filter the flights departing from "COLUMBUS" to "HOUSTON" with a stop in "NASHVILLE" on the specified date.

    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0;
```

### Notes:
- You will need to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for tomorrow’s date.
- This query checks that the flight stops at Indianapolis while departing from Cleveland and arriving in San Diego. Ensure that you have proper indices on tables for performance optimization especially if working with large datasets.
- `DISTINCT` ensures that you do not get duplicate flight IDs.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight that leaves on Friday from Philadelphia to Dallas and makes a stop in Atlanta, you can write the following SQL query. This query joins several tables to get the necessary information and applies the required conditions related to the departure city, destination, stopover city, and the day of the week:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias2, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 
WHERE 
     CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA'
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS'
     AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
     AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
     AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
     AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY';
```

### Explanation
- This query selects distinct flight IDs for flights that:
  - Depart from Philadelphia (`FROM_AIRPORT`) to Dallas (`TO_AIRPORT`).
  - Make a stop in Atlanta (`STOP_AIRPORT`).
  - Occur on Fridays (`DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY'`).
- It involves multiple joins between the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables to fulfill the requirements of the query. 
- It ensures that the relationships and conditions for the airports and cities reflect the desired routes and stops correctly.

Raw LLM Response:
To book a flight from TAMPA to SEATTLE with a stop in MILWAUKEE on a specific date (5/26), you would need to find flights that fulfill these criteria and potentially create a SQL query that captures the multi-leg flight details effectively. Here’s how you could structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2,
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias2, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE"
    AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
    AND DATE_DAY.DAY_NUMBER = 26 
    AND DATE_DAY.MONTH_NUMBER = 5 
    AND DATE_DAY.YEAR = desired_year 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYS.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We identify and join the relevant tables for the departure airport (TAMPA), the stop (MILWAUKEE), and the destination airport (SEATTLE).
- We ensure that the flight includes a stop in Milwaukee and departs from TAMPA to SEATTLE.
- The `DATE_DAY` conditions would need to reference a specific year (`desired_year`).
- Additionally, the query uses `FLIGHT_STOP` to make sure you're capturing the appropriate flight that stops in Milwaukee.

Make sure to replace `desired_year` with the actual year you're querying for (e.g., 2023) to ensure the query runs correctly.

To get a list of round trip flights between INDIANAPOLIS and ORLANDO, FL for the 27th and 28th of December, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"

     OR FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '2023-12-28 00:00:00' AND '2023-12-28 23:59:59');
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: Selects the unique flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, ...**: Joins several tables (airport services, cities, fares, flights) to gather relevant information.
3. **WHERE**: 
   - Filters for flights departing from `INDIANAPOLIS` (the source city) and arriving in `ORLANDO` (the destination city).
   - Checks for round trip tickets (assumes `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is a flag that indicates this).
   - Filters for departure times on either the 27th or 28th of December 2023, checking if `DEPARTURE_TIME` falls within the specified date range.

Make sure to adjust any literals like dates or city names according to your precise requirements or database format.

### Explanation:

1. **Joins**: 
   - The query joins the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables to link the relevant details for both routes.
   
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - It filters based on the city names (Boston and Atlanta).
   
3. **ORDER BY**: 
   - It orders the Boston to Atlanta flights by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order to get the earliest flight.
   - It orders the Atlanta to Boston flights by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in descending order to get the latest flight.
  
4. **LIMIT**: 
   - It retrieves the first flight from Boston to Atlanta and the last flight from Atlanta to Boston.

Please adjust the fields you want to select as needed, such as adding additional flight information.

Question: what flights are there from CLEVELAND to MIAMI on US that arrive in MIAMI before 1600
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Cleveland to Miami on US Airlines that arrive in Miami before 16:00 (4 PM), we will join the relevant tables to get the required data. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
  AND AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_NAME = "US" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '16:00';
```

**Explanation:**
- The query selects distinct Flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the correct ICE `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` for Cleveland and Miami respectively.
- Additionally, it filters the results to include only flights from the airline with the code for US Airlines (assumed from the provided data).
- Finally, it checks that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is before `16:00`.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

Question: what is the cost of LIMOUSINE service in PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of limousine service in Philadelphia, you can use the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which contains information about transportation types and their fares. Since Philadelphia is a city and has a corresponding airport, you will need to identify the correct `CITY_CODE` for Philadelphia and then retrieve the ground fare for the limousine service.

Here is the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';
```

This query retrieves the ground fare for limousine service in Philadelphia by linking the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table based on the corresponding city code.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';

Question: please list the prices for a RENTAL CAR in PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
The provided database schema did not include a specific table for rental cars, therefore it is presumed that rental car prices are not available in the current schema.

However, if rental car information were stored in a table, the SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR";
```

This query assumes there is a `TRANSPORT_TYPE` column in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table that specifies the type of transportation (e.g., "RENTAL CAR"). The actual implementation would depend on how the rental car data is structured in the database. If there is no specific table for rental cars, a query cannot be constructed based on the provided schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query the rental car rates in Dallas, assuming we have relevant information in a table (which isn't in the provided schema), we'd typically need an appropriate table that might store car rental information, such as rental locations, rates, car types, etc. 

However, since the provided schema does not include a rental car table, I'll fabricate a possible table structure for the sake of the example. Let's assume there's a table named `RENTAL_CAR` with columns like `RENTAL_COMPANY`, `CITY_CODE`, `CAR_TYPE`, `DAILY_RATE`.

Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT RENTAL_CAR.RENTAL_COMPANY, RENTAL_CAR.CAR_TYPE, RENTAL_CAR.DAILY_RATE 
FROM RENTAL_CAR
JOIN CITY ON RENTAL_CAR.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS";
```

This query selects the rental companies, car types, and their corresponding daily rates for cars available in Dallas, joining the `RENTAL_CAR` table with the `CITY` table to filter the results based on the city name. 

If there is no `RENTAL_CAR` table or similar entity in your actual database schema, you would need to create one or adjust your query according to whatever structure you have for rental car information.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT RENTAL_CAR.RENTAL_COMPANY, RENTAL_CAR.CAR_TYPE, RENTAL_CAR.DAILY_RATE 
FROM RENTAL_CAR
JOIN CITY ON RENTAL_CAR.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS";

Question: how much would RENTAL CAR cost in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the cost of a rental car in Atlanta based on the provided database schema, you would typically rely on a specific table related to ground services or rental cars. However, since there is no explicit table for rental car prices in the schema you've provided, we need to check if any of the existing tables might contain that information.

Assuming rental car costs are part of the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which includes the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` columns, we could write a query like the following to get the cost of rental cars in Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA")
AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR";
```

In this query:
- We retrieve the distinct rental car costs from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to ensure we're getting services for the correct airport.
- We filter by the city code associated with Atlanta and specify that the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` should be "RENTAL CAR". 

Make sure to adjust table and column names as required based on your actual database schema!

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
It seems that the database schema you provided does not contain a table explicitly named for rental car rates. However, if we assume the existence of a table for rental car services or rates at airports (which could logically be included in the schema), a possible SQL query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO";
```

This query assumes:
- There is a `GROUND_SERVICE` table that includes rental car rates.
- The `GROUND_FARE` field in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table contains the rental car rates.
- The `AIRPORT` table provides the names or identifiers for the airports to match with San Francisco.

Please verify whether a suitable table exists and adjust the query accordingly based on your actual database schema.

Question: how expensive is the SAN FRANCISCO LIMOUSINE service
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of the SAN FRANCISCO LIMOUSINE service, you would need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, where the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` indicates limousines, and the `CITY_CODE` corresponds to SAN FRANCISCO. Here's an SQL query that could accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE";
```

This query retrieves the fare for limousine service in SAN FRANCISCO by joining the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to ensure you're looking at the correct city. Make sure that "LIMOUSINE" matches the exact `TRANSPORT_TYPE` in your database for it to work correctly.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE";

Question: how much does it cost to RENTAL CAR in TACOMA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query the cost of rental cars in Tacoma, it seems your database schema does not provide a specific table related to rental cars. However, you may want to check for any information in `GROUND_SERVICE` that might include transportation types like rental cars. Assuming the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` might include rental cars, here’s how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR";
```

In this query:
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to filter for services in Tacoma.
- We filter the transportation type to look specifically for rental cars.
- Finally, we select the distinctive rental car costs in Tacoma. 

Make sure to adjust the `"RENTAL CAR"` string based on how the transport types are actually coded in your `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR";

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the rental car rates in Dallas, you would typically need to check if there is a `RENTAL_CAR` table or a similar structure in your database schema since it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the provided schema. Assuming there's a relevant table or service associated with car rentals at airports, you would likely need to join that table with the appropriate airport and city information.

If we assume there's an imaginary table `CAR_RENTAL` structured like this:

- **CAR_RENTAL(CITY_CODE, AIRPORT_CODE, TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_FARE)**

Here's a potential SQL query to retrieve rental car rates in Dallas:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CAR_RENTAL.GROUND_FARE 
FROM CAR_RENTAL AS CAR_RENTALalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON CAR_RENTALalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS";
```

This query selects distinct rental car rates from the `CAR_RENTAL` table for rental services available in Dallas by joining the relevant tables for airport and city data. If your actual schema includes a differently named table or structure for rental cars, you would adapt this query to fit that schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CAR_RENTAL.GROUND_FARE 
FROM CAR_RENTAL AS CAR_RENTALalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON CAR_RENTALalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS";

Question: show me a list of RENTAL CAR fares at BOSTON airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of rental car fares at Boston airport, you would typically reference the relevant tables related to ground services or transportation services. Assuming that the transportation fares are included in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table which connects `CITY` and `AIRPORT`, the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = "Boston";
```

Here's what the query does:
- Selects distinct transportation types and fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- Joins with the `AIRPORT` table to match the airport code and with the `CITY` table to filter by the city name.
- Filters specifically for the Boston airport by looking for the airport name. 

Make sure to check the actual entries in your database for the exact airport name, as it might differ (e.g., "BOSTON LOGAN" or "BOSTON AIRPORT").

Raw LLM Response:
To find the costs of rental cars in Dallas, your query should involve an appropriate table that has rental car information, which isn't included in the provided schema. If we assume that there's a table for rental cars (e.g., `RENTAL_CAR`), the query might look like the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT RENTAL_CAR.CAR_TYPE, RENTAL_CAR.COST
FROM RENTAL_CAR
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON RENTAL_CAR.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

Since we do not have a specific `RENTAL_CAR` table in the schema you provided, please verify the actual schema for rental car information, if it exists. If rental car details are instead stored in a different table, adjust the table names and fields accordingly to fetch the rental car costs in Dallas.

Question: how much does the LIMOUSINE service cost within PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of limousine service within Pittsburgh, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that "PITTSBURGH" is represented in your database correctly and that the relevant information about ground services, including the transport type for limousine, is captured in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE";
```

This query selects distinct ground fares for limousine service by joining the relevant tables and filtering for the city 'PITTSBURGH' and the transport type 'LIMOUSINE'. Make sure that `TRANSPORT_TYPE` properly reflects 'LIMOUSINE' in your dataset. Adjust it accordingly if the terminology differs in your schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE";

Question: can you list costs of DENVER RENTAL CAR
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the costs of rental cars in Denver, you would likely need a table that includes car rental pricing information. However, based on the database schema provided, there is no direct mention of car rental services or rental car costs. The schema primarily covers airlines, airports, flights, fares, etc.

If there were a hypothetical `RENTAL_CAR` table (for demonstration purposes), the SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT RENTAL_CAR.CAR_TYPE, RENTAL_CAR.COST_PER_DAY
FROM RENTAL_CAR
WHERE RENTAL_CAR.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DENVER');
```

In this case, you're selecting car types and their costs per day from a `RENTAL_CAR` table, filtered by city code corresponding to Denver.

If you wish to review available car rental prices, please check the related tables or context that might be missing in the provided schema. If you have a specific table for rental cars, please provide that information for a more accurate SQL query.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT RENTAL_CAR.CAR_TYPE, RENTAL_CAR.COST_PER_DAY
FROM RENTAL_CAR
WHERE RENTAL_CAR.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DENVER');

To retrieve flights from ATLANTA to BOSTON on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, we will utilize the various tables associated with airports, cities, flights, and days. The SQL query will filter based on the specified cities, days, and time conditions.

       AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00') 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Aliases**: We are using aliases for each table to make the query easier to read (`AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`, `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`, etc.).
2. **City Filters**: The query checks the source (`ATLANTA`) and destination (`BOSTON`) cities.
3. **Departure Filters**: 
   - For flights on Wednesday, it checks that `DEPARTURE_TIME` is in the afternoon (between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM).
   - For Thursday, it checks that `DEPARTURE_TIME` is in the morning (between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM).
4. **Join Conditions**: The tables are joined based on city codes and airport codes to ensure correct matches.
5. **Distinct Results**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that the results do not contain duplicates.

This query retrieves the IDs of the flights that match the specified conditions. Adjust the time format as necessary based on how your database stores the time values.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from ATLANTA to BOSTON on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, you need to join the relevant tables and apply the necessary conditions. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
AND (    (DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59') 
      OR (DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "THURSDAY" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '11:59:59')
    ) 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
- It joins the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables to match the respective cities (ATLANTA and BOSTON).
- It filters by the days of the week (WEDNESDAY and THURSDAY) and by the time of departure to capture flights that leave in the afternoon on Wednesday (after 12:00 PM but before 6:00 PM) and in the morning on Thursday (after midnight but before 12:00 PM). 
- Finally, it ensures that the flight days match the day names retrieved from the DAYS table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Atlanta to Boston on Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon, you can write a SQL query that filters the flights based on the departure airport, destination airport, the day of the week, and the specific time ranges for morning and afternoon flights.

Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND (
          (DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY' AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '12:00:00') OR
          (DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'THURSDAY' AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00')
      ) 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Distinct Flight IDs**: We use `SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID` to retrieve unique flight IDs from our results.
- **Joining Tables**: We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to match the desired departure and arrival cities.
- **Filtering for Flights**: 
  - We filter for flights from Atlanta to Boston.
  - We check if the day is Wednesday and the departure time is in the morning (`BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '12:00:00'`).
  - We check if the day is Thursday and the departure time is in the afternoon (`BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00'`).
- **Matching Days**: We ensure that the flights adhere to the specified days represented in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column by linking with the `DAYS` table.

Question: what is the total seating capacity of all aircraft of AA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE , AIRCRAFTalias0.CAPACITY FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 , EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To calculate the total seating capacity of all aircraft operated by American Airlines (AA), you will need to join the `AIRCRAFT`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRLINE` tables. The total seating capacity can be obtained by summing the `CAPACITY` field for all aircraft associated with flights operated by American Airlines. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT SUM(AIRCRAFT.CAPACITY) AS TOTAL_CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
JOIN FLIGHT ON AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE = FLIGHT.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

This query will give you the total seating capacity of all aircraft operated by American Airlines.

PETERSBURG" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the shortest flights from Nashville to St. Petersburg, we need to look for flights departing from Nashville and arriving in St. Petersburg, and sort them by flight duration. Assuming that the relevant information about flight duration can be derived from the `TIME_ELAPSED` field in the `FLIGHT` table, the following SQL query can be used:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED ASC;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This part selects unique flight IDs from the results.
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, ...**: Tables join to find connecting data for flights from Nashville to St. Petersburg.
- **WHERE** clause: It specifies the conditions such that the departure city is Nashville and the destination city is St. Petersburg.
- **ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED ASC**: This orders the results by the duration of the flight in ascending order, which helps in identifying the shortest flights first. 

Make sure that your database schema provides enough information to calculate or retrieve the time duration (in the `TIME_ELAPSED` field) to ensure that this query functions correctly.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine the shortest trip between Boston and San Francisco, we will need to consider the flights that connect these two cities and calculate the time elapsed for each flight. Furthermore, we'll need to ensure that the resulting query captures information related to the departure and arrival airports, along with the total travel time.

Here is the SQL query to find the shortest trip between Boston and San Francisco:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE)
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **Table Joins**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to relate the flights from Boston to San Francisco.
- **Conditions**: It checks for the cities specified and links them to their respective airports to filter the flights.
- **Sorting and Limiting**: It orders the results based on `TIME_ELAPSED` in ascending order, so the shortest duration comes first, and limits the results to the top record using `LIMIT 1`. 

This query will provide the flight ID and the duration of the shortest trip from Boston to San Francisco.

Question: shortest flight from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the shortest flight from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA, you can use the following SQL query. This query will fetch the flight details between the two cities and order the results by the flight duration (assuming that `TIME_ELAPSED` in the `FLIGHT` table represents the flight duration).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs for flights from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to ensure that the correct airport codes are associated with each city.
- It checks that the flight is traveling from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA based on airport codes.
- The `ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED ASC` clause sorts the flights in ascending order by their duration, so the shortest flight appears first.
- `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the shortest flight is returned. 

Make sure that `TIME_ELAPSED` is indeed the correct field representing the flight duration in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the shortest flight from SAN JOSE to HOUSTON, we need to leverage the data available in our schema. This involves finding the flight that connects these two cities and has the shortest duration, calculated from the arrival time and departure time provided in the `FLIGHT` table.

Here is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       (FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME - FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS FLIGHT_DURATION
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHT_DURATION ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query starts by selecting the flight ID, departure time, arrival time, and calculates the flight duration by subtracting the departure time from the arrival time.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to link the cities "SAN JOSE" and "HOUSTON" with their respective airport codes.
- The `FLIGHT` table is used to ensure that we are only looking at flights that depart from SAN JOSE and arrive in HOUSTON.
- The results are ordered by `FLIGHT_DURATION` in ascending order to find the shortest flight.
- Finally, we limit the results to just one record to get the shortest flight.

Question: how many flights has CO into and out of ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" ) OR ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To calculate the number of flights operated by a specific airline (in this case, "CO" which likely refers to Continental Airlines) into and out of Atlanta, you need to perform a query joining the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT_SERVICE table, filtering by the airline code and the specific airport code for Atlanta. 

Assuming the airport code for Atlanta is "ATL," the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS NUMBER_OF_FLIGHTS 
FROM FLIGHT 
WHERE FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO' 
AND (FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL');
```

This query counts distinct flight IDs where the airline is "CO" and the flight either departs from or arrives at Atlanta ("ATL").
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID) AS NUMBER_OF_FLIGHTS 
FROM FLIGHT 
WHERE FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO' 
AND (FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL');

Question: what is the aircraft type with the greatest seating capacity
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.CAPACITY = ( SELECT MAX( AIRCRAFTalias1.CAPACITY ) FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the aircraft type with the greatest seating capacity, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT AIRCRAFT_CODE, AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
ORDER BY CAPACITY DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query selects the `AIRCRAFT_CODE`, `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION`, and `CAPACITY` from the `AIRCRAFT` table, orders the results by `CAPACITY` in descending order, and limits the output to the top 1 result, which will give you the aircraft type with the greatest seating capacity.

```

### Explanation:
- The query creates a cross-reference of the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables for both departure (ATLANTA) and destination (PHILADELPHIA) airports.
- It joins with the FLIGHT, FLIGHT_FARE, FARE, DATE_DAY, and DAYS tables to ensure it captures flights on the specified date (August 1).
- Finally, it selects the minimum round trip cost for the identified flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest round trip fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 25, the SQL query would need to incorporate details about the cities, the corresponding airports, and the fare details for round trips on that specific date. Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Cheapest_Round_Trip_Fare
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 
ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS")
AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO")
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 
ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
JOIN DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 
ON DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 25 
AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 
AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- 'year0' should be replaced with the actual year if needed
WHERE FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' signifies that a round trip is required
```

This query does the following:

1. Joins the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for Indianapolis and Orlando to obtain their respective airport codes.
2. Joins the `FLIGHT` table to find flights from Indianapolis to Orlando.
3. Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare details.
4. Filters for the specific date of December 25 and looks for the minimum round-trip cost.

Replace `year0` with the specific year for the flight if required. If `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is represented differently, adjust the condition accordingly.

In this query:
- We are looking for flights between Indianapolis (IND) and Orlando (ORL).
- We filter by the specific date, December 27.
- We retrieve the cheapest round trip cost using a subquery to find the minimum round trip cost from the selected routes.
- The query assumes that there are predefined mappings of airport codes to city names through the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To check for flights on a Tuesday before 10:00 AM from Baltimore to San Francisco using a 747 aircraft, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"

       AND AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE 
       AND AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%747%';
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins the necessary tables to filter flights that match the criteria: 
  - Departing from Baltimore ("BALTIMORE") to San Francisco ("SAN FRANCISCO").
  - The flight should be on a Tuesday and should leave before 10:00 AM.
  - It checks for the aircraft type in the `AIRCRAFT` table, ensuring that it is a 747.
  
Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values corresponding to the desired Tuesday date.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights in FIRST class on American Airlines (AA) from Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) to San Francisco International Airport (SFO), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE

  AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - The query involves `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the airport information for both Dallas Fort Worth and San Francisco.
   - The `CITY` table is used to match the city names with their respective codes.
   - The `FLIGHT` table contains flight details, while the `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables are used to filter based on the flight class.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query checks that the flight is from "DALLAS FORT WORTH" to "SAN FRANCISCO".
   - It specifically looks for flights operated by American Airlines (AA) and filters for FIRST class tickets.

3. **Distinct Results**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that the results do not show duplicate flight IDs.

Question: what are the different classes of service and the prices for US
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS , FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the different classes of service and their prices for flights within the US, we would join the relevant tables, focusing on `CLASS_OF_SERVICE`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS`. Since prices are typically associated with fare basis codes, we also consider the `FARE_BASIS` table to get the class type and related prices. 

Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE.BOOKING_CLASS, 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE.CLASS_DESCRIPTION, 
    FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE 
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS ON CLASS_OF_SERVICE.BOOKING_CLASS = FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS 
JOIN 
    FARE ON FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
WHERE 
    FARE.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE COUNTRY_NAME = 'UNITED STATES') 
    AND FARE.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE COUNTRY_NAME = 'UNITED STATES') 
ORDER BY 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE.RANK;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Clause**: We retrieve relevant columns, including the class of service, class description, fare basis code, and costs.
- **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: We join the `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table with `FARE_BASIS` and `FARE` to have a full view of prices associated with each class of service.
- **WHERE Clause**: We filter to ensure that we only consider flights that originate and terminate in the United States.
- **ORDER BY Clause**: This orders the results by the rank of class, which typically reflects their hierarchy (e.g., economy, business, first class).

This query will yield a list of service classes and their associated prices for flights that operate within the U.S.

ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;  -- This will return the earliest flight only
```

**Notes:**
1. Remember to replace `year0` with the specific year you want to query for.
2. The `ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME` ensures that the results are sorted by the departure time, and using `LIMIT 1` gives you the earliest flight.
3. The query assumes that "DALLAS FORT WORTH" is represented by the corresponding airport code in the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table. If it has a specific airport code such as "DFW", you might need to adjust that.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a daily flight schedule between Boston and Pittsburgh, you would need to query the relevant tables to find flights that operate daily between those two cities. The SQL query would typically require joining tables to link flights, airports, and city information along with the days of operation.

Here is an example SQL query to show the daily flight schedule between Boston and Pittsburgh:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME

```

This query includes the following:

- It selects distinct flight IDs, flight numbers, departure times, and arrival times.
- It joins the necessary tables (like `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`) to connect the city names to the corresponding flights.
- It filters for flights from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH and ensures that the flights are marked as daily (a simplified condition for daily operations, as comprehensive requirements would depend on the specific implementation of your flight schedule). 

Make sure to adjust the conditions based on how `FLIGHT_DAYS` is coded in your database. In some systems, daily flights could simply be represented with a specific day code that denotes all days, or could require additional logic for accurate results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first flight into Houston from Dallas on March 1st and the last flight from Houston to Dallas on the same date, you can use SQL queries that filter for these specific conditions. 

Here's how you might construct those queries:

### SQL Query for the First Flight into Houston from Dallas on March 1st:
```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
            SELECT MIN(FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME)
            FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
            WHERE FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2023-03-01 00:00:00'
                  AND FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME < '2023-03-02 00:00:00'
            AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
            AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      );
```

### SQL Query for the Last Flight from Houston to Dallas on March 1st:
```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
            SELECT MAX(FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME)
            FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
            WHERE FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2023-03-01 00:00:00'
                  AND FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME < '2023-03-02 00:00:00'
            AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
            AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      );
```

### Explanation
1. **Join Tables**: The queries join the relevant tables to find the flights based on city codes and airport codes for Dallas and Houston.
2. **Filtering by Date**: The `WHERE` condition is used to restrict the search for flights only on March 1st, using appropriate time checks.
3. **Min and Max Departure Times**: Subqueries are used to determine the first flight (minimum departure time) into Houston from Dallas and the last flight (maximum departure time) from Houston to Dallas. 

Adjust the date format to match your database's date field format as necessary.

Question: show me the most expensive fare
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FARE AS FAREalias0 WHERE FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST = ( SELECT MAX( FAREalias1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ) FROM FARE AS FAREalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias1.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the most expensive fare, you can query the `FARE` table and find the maximum value of either `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` or `ROUND_TRIP_COST`, depending on your definition of "most expensive." Here's an SQL query that retrieves the details of the fare that has the highest round trip cost, if that is what you are looking for:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FARE
WHERE ROUND_TRIP_COST = (SELECT MAX(ROUND_TRIP_COST) FROM FARE);
```

If you're interested in the most expensive one-direction fare instead, you could use this query instead:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FARE
WHERE ONE_DIRECTION_COST = (SELECT MAX(ONE_DIRECTION_COST) FROM FARE);
```

These queries will give you the full details of the fare record that is the most expensive as defined by the selected cost type. Adjust the queries as needed based on whether you are focusing on one-way or round-trip fares.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT *
FROM FARE
WHERE ROUND_TRIP_COST = (SELECT MAX(ROUND_TRIP_COST) FROM FARE);
✅ Exact match: False

Raw LLM Response:
To show the flights from IAD (Washington Dulles International Airport) to San Francisco that leave after 18:00, the SQL query would be as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "IAD"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **Distinct Selection**: `SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID` is used to get unique flight IDs.
- **From Clause**: Uses several tables to get relevant data about the flights, cities, and airport services.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all overnight flights from Washington to San Francisco and their associated fares, you will need to define what constitutes an "overnight" flight. Typically, an overnight flight is one that departs in the evening and arrives the next morning or late night. 

Below is a SQL example that captures this scenario while assuming that an overnight flight departs between 8 PM and 11:59 PM and arrives after 12 AM. You may adjust the departure times and conditions according to your requirements:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '20:00:00' -- Departure time after 8 PM
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '24:00:00' -- Before midnight
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '12:00:00' -- Arrival time on the next day
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM**: Specifies the necessary tables involved in the selection.
- **WHERE**: Includes multiple conditions: 
  - Ensures the departure city is Washington and destination city is San Francisco.
  - Filters on departure and arrival times to capture overnight flights.
- **SELECT**: Retrieves distinct flight IDs and their corresponding round-trip fares.

### Note:
- Adjust the times and definitions as needed to fit specific criteria for overnight flights.
- Ensure to verify the time formats in the database for accurate comparisons.

Raw LLM Response:
To book an early morning flight from DALLAS into HOUSTON on February 22 and returning late in the evening of the same day, you would typically structure your SQL query as follows. This will retrieve the flights that match the specified criteria:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
;

-- For the return flight, you could use a similar query
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '23:59:59'
      AND FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
;
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Query**: Retrieves all early morning flights from DALLAS to HOUSTON on February 22 by checking the departure times between 5:00 AM and 12:00 PM.
2. **Second Query**: Retrieves all late evening flights returning from HOUSTON to DALLAS on the same day, checking departure times between 6:00 PM and 11:59 PM.
3. **DATE_DAY Filtering**: Ensure you specify the correct month and day for the flights.
4. **FLIGHT_DAYS Filtering**: This ensures the flights are available on the specified day. (`DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE` will need to be derived from the date you want to filter on.)

Make sure to replace `year0` with the actual year you are querying for, which should correspond to February 22 of that year.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the flights that leave SAN FRANCISCO after 2000 (8:00 PM) and go to DALLAS FORT WORTH, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS FORT WORTH" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '20:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**:
   - Join the relevant tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`) to gather data about departures and arrivals.

2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filter for the departure city - `SAN FRANCISCO` and arrival city - `DALLAS FORT WORTH`.
   - Check that the departure time is after `20:00:00`.

3. **DISTINCT**:
   - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that duplicate flight IDs are not included in the result set. 

Make sure that the format of `DEPARTURE_TIME` in your database matches the formatted string used in the SQL query.

Question: is the AA flight 813 from BOSTON to OAKLAND a nonstop flight
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if American Airlines flight 813 from Boston to Oakland is a nonstop flight, you can write an SQL query that checks for flights with the specified airline, flight number, departure city (Boston), and arrival city (Oakland). A nonstop flight will not have any stops, which means that the `FLIGHT_STOP` table should not have any entries for that specific flight. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM 
    FLIGHT 
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '813' 
    AND FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_BOSTON
        JOIN CITY AS C_BOSTON ON AS_BOSTON.CITY_CODE = C_BOSTON.CITY_CODE
        WHERE C_BOSTON.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    )
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS_OAKLAND
        JOIN CITY AS C_OAKLAND ON AS_OAKLAND.CITY_CODE = C_OAKLAND.CITY_CODE
        WHERE C_OAKLAND.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND'
    )
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID NOT IN (
        SELECT FLIGHT_STOP.FLIGHT_ID 
        FROM FLIGHT_STOP 
        WHERE FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_NUMBER > 0
    );
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT Table:** The primary table being queried is `FLIGHT`, which contains details about all flights.
2. **Airline Code & Flight Number:** The query filters for American Airlines (`'AA'`) and flight number `813`.
3. **FROM_AIRPORT & TO_AIRPORT:** Subqueries are used to match the airports corresponding to Boston and Oakland based on the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
4. **Nonstop Check:** The `NOT IN` clause ensures that there are no entries in the `FLIGHT_STOP` table where the `STOP_NUMBER` is greater than 0, indicating that the flight has no stops and is therefore nonstop.

This query should provide you with whether the specified flight is a nonstop flight or not.

Question: is the AA flight 813 from BOSTON to OAKLAND a flight that goes straight through from BOSTON to OAKLAND without stopping at another city
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if flight AA 813 from Boston to Oakland is a direct flight (i.e., it does not stop at another city), you need to query the `FLIGHT` table and check for any stops associated with that specific flight. The relevant SQL statement could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '813'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (
      SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
      FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
      WHERE CITY_CODE = (
          SELECT CITY_CODE 
          FROM CITY 
          WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
      )
  )
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (
      SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
      FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
      WHERE CITY_CODE = (
          SELECT CITY_CODE 
          FROM CITY 
          WHERE CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND'
      )
  )
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming `STOPS` column indicates the number of stops
```

This SQL query does the following:

1. Selects the `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table where the airline code is 'AA' and the flight number is '813'.
2. Checks if the flight's departure airport corresponds to Boston and the destination airport corresponds to Oakland.
3. Ensures that the number of stops for that flight is zero, meaning it goes straight from Boston to Oakland without any layovers. 

Note: Please confirm the presence of the `STOPS` column in the `FLIGHT` table, as this is commonly used to denote whether a flight is direct or has layovers. If not available, you might need to join with the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to check for any stops associated with that flight.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0

  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '813'

Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights on UA (United Airlines) and NW (Northwest Airlines) that go into Denver, as well as all flights on NW and UA that fly out of Denver, you can use the following SQL queries:

1. **Flights into Denver**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ('UA', 'NW');
```

2. **Flights out of Denver**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ('NW', 'UA');
```

You can also combine both into a single query if desired:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ('UA', 'NW')
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ('NW', 'UA');
```

This combined query returns all distinct flight IDs for flights into Denver from UA and NW, as well as flights out of Denver for NW and UA.

Raw LLM Response:
To find nonstop flights between Boston and Dallas that leave between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, you would perform a query that checks both the departure times and ensures the flights do not have any stops. Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '14:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FROM` clause combines the necessary tables to link cities to airport services and ensure we're looking at the right flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights that:
  - Depart from Boston and arrive in Dallas.
  - Have no stops (`FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0`).
  - Depart between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM (`DEPARTURE_TIME` criteria). 

This query will return the distinct flight IDs for nonstop flights that meet the specified conditions.

Question: okay what i'd like to do on this one is go from WASHINGTON to ATLANTA i want a nonstop and i'd like to leave around 5pm
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= departure_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To formulate an SQL query based on your requirements of flying from WASHINGTON to ATLANTA, with a preference for nonstop flights departing around 5 PM, you would structure the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Distinct FLIGHT_ID**: Ensures no duplicate flight IDs are returned.
2. **Joining Tables**: The query involves joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both departure and arrival cities, and the `CITY` table to filter for the specific cities.
3. **Filters**:
   - **Departure City**: Ensures that the flight departs from WASHINGTON.
   - **Arrival City**: Ensures the flight arrives in ATLANTA.
   - **Nonstop Flights**: The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` filters for nonstop flights.
   - **Departure Time**: The condition checks that the flight departs between 5 PM and 6 PM. This allows for some flexibility around the stated time.

Make sure that the actual field names, especially for `STOPS`, match those in your actual database schema (if "STOPS" doesn’t exist, you may need to adjust accordingly).

Raw LLM Response:
To show all direct flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO or OAKLAND that arrive before 10:00 AM local time, you need to filter for direct flights, check the arrival airports, and ensure the arrival time meets the specified criteria. Here is the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     TIME_ZONE AS TIME_ZONEalias0, 
     TIME_ZONE AS TIME_ZONEalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND (CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" OR CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND")
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
      AND FLIGHTalias1.ARRIVAL_TIME < ( 
          SELECT TIME_ZONEalias1.HOURS_FROM_GMT + 10 * 60 
          FROM TIME_ZONE AS TIME_ZONEalias1 
          WHERE TIME_ZONEalias1.TIME_ZONE_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.TIME_ZONE_CODE
      );
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Joins the necessary tables to get the city information, airport services, and flight details.
2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters cities for BOSTON (departure) and either SAN FRANCISCO or OAKLAND (arrival).
   - Ensures the flight departs from the correct airport and arrives at the correct destination.
   - Checks that the number of stops is 0 for direct flights.
   - Filters for flights that arrive before 10:00 AM local time. The conversion from local time to GMT/UTC is done using the time zone information from the respective airport.

Adjust the time conversion logic as necessary based on the specific representation of arrival time in your database. The `TIME_ZONE` calculation in the `WHERE` clause is based on the assumption that arrival times are stored without timezone adjustments; modify accordingly if that assumption is incorrect.

Question: what is the cost of the AIR TAXI OPERATION at PHL airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "PHL" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "AIR TAXI OPERATION" ;
Raw LLM Response:
The query to find the cost of the AIR TAXI OPERATION at PHL airport involves checking the relevant tables for information about ground services or airport services specific to PHL (Philadelphia International Airport). The schema does not provide a direct reference to 'AIR TAXI OPERATION cost', so we typically look at the `GROUND_SERVICE` table for transportation types including taxis associated with the relevant airport. 

Here's the possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHL' AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'AIR TAXI OPERATION';
```

This query retrieves the ground fare specifically for air taxi operations at Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). If the transport type is stored differently, please adjust the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` value accordingly.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHL' AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'AIR TAXI OPERATION';

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Joins the necessary tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FLIGHT, FARE, and FLIGHT_FARE) to gather information about flights and related fare.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters by the departure city (WASHINGTON) and arrival city (DENVER).
   - Specifies the date by the month (April) and day (20).
   - Checks the departure time to find flights around 5 AM.
   - Finds the minimum fare for that flight.
3. **MIN Subquery**: The inner query is used to find the least expensive one-direction cost for round trips between WASHINGTON and DENVER on the specified date. 

Adjust the year in the date filters accordingly based on your requirements.

Question: show me all the night fares between PHILADELPHIA and SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the night fares between Philadelphia and San Francisco, you would need to join the relevant tables, including `CITY`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`, ensuring you filter for night fares. Here’s how the SQL query can be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.NIGHT = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a night fare
```

### Explanation:
1. **City Filtering**: The `CITY` table is used to filter for both Philadelphia and San Francisco to get their respective city codes.
2. **Airport Service**: The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is utilized to get the airport codes associated with those cities.
3. **Flight and Fare Details**: The `FLIGHT` table provides information about the flights, which is then joined with the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to filter for night fares.
4. **Night Fare Condition**: The final condition checks that the fare is a night fare (assuming that a night's fare is indicated by 'Y' in the `NIGHT` column of the `FARE` table).

Make sure to adjust any column names or conditions based on the actual data configuration.

Question: hi i want a round trip ticket to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get a round trip ticket to Dallas (DENVER to DALLAS), you would typically need to look up flights that match the criteria of departing from your origin city (in this example, assuming it's DENVER) and arriving at DALLAS, while ensuring that the fare associated with those flights is for a round trip.

Here's an SQL query to find the flights (both outbound and return) that meet this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
      AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables used**: The query pulls data from several tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`.
2. **City Filters**: It filters cities to ensure one is Denver (`"DENVER"`) and the other is Dallas (`"DALLAS"`).
3. **Airports**: It connects the city services to the flight information based on the originating and destination airports.
4. **Round Trip Requirement**: It checks if the fare requires a round trip.
5. **Distinct Flights**: Finally, it selects distinct flight IDs and corresponding round trip costs.

Please adjust the cities in the query depending on your actual departure city. Depending on the database design, further adjustments may be needed to refine the selection based on specific date criteria for the round trip.

- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with cities for both the departure (BOSTON) and arrival (SAN FRANCISCO).
- Ensures that the selected flights are from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO.
- Filters on the `FARE_BASIS` table to check for the "ECONOMY" class type and that it is classified as a night flight (`NIGHT = 'YES'`).
- Selects distinct flight IDs to avoid duplicates. 

Make sure to replace `'YES'` with the actual representation of night service in your database schema if it varies. This query should provide you with the list of suitable flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flight schedule from BALTIMORE to SAN FRANCISCO on FRIDAY nights, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '18:00:00' -- Filtering for night flights; you can adjust the time as needed
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **Selecting Distinct**: Retrieves unique flight IDs along with their departure and arrival times to avoid duplicates.
- **Joining Tables**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to ensure relevant information is gathered.
- **City Conditions**: Filters the cities to ensure you are looking for flights from BALTIMORE to SAN FRANCISCO.
- **Day Condition**: Ensures the flights are on Fridays by matching the `DAY_NAME`.
- **Time Condition**: Adjusts for flights departing on Friday nights by adding a condition on `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
- **Ordering**: Sorts the results by departure time for better readability. 

Make sure to adjust the time filter based on your definition of "Friday nights". The example uses `18:00` as a cutoff for evening flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the earliest flight from San Francisco to Atlanta that is operated by Delta Air Lines (DL) and to check if a meal is being served, we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
           SELECT MIN(FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME) 
           FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 
           WHERE FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
             AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
             AND FLIGHTalias1.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL"
      );
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Aliases**: We have given aliases to the tables (e.g., `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FOOD_SERVICE`) for easier referencing.
2. **JOIN Conditions**: We are joining the relevant services and city tables to filter on cities, alongside the flight information.
3. **Flight Criteria**: We filter for flights from San Francisco to Atlanta, ensuring the airline code corresponds to Delta Air Lines (`DL`).
4. **Earliest Flight**: We use a subquery to find the minimum departure time for the specified flight route and airline.
5. **Meal Check**: We also join with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to check if a meal is being served by comparing `MEAL_CODE`. 

This query will return the flight ID and the meal description if a meal is being served on the earliest flight from San Francisco to Atlanta on Delta Air Lines.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the departure time of the latest flight of United Airlines (UA) from Denver to Boston, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA"
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **FROM Clause**: The query joins the necessary tables to get the relevant airport and city information for both Denver and Boston.
- **WHERE Clause**: It filters the flights to ensure that you only consider flights from Denver to Boston operated by United Airlines (UA).
- **ORDER BY Clause**: The results are ordered by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` in descending order so that the latest flight appears first.
- **LIMIT 1**: This ensures that only the latest flight's departure time is returned.

Executing this query will yield the departure time of the latest flight from Denver to Boston on United Airlines.

In this SQL query, we are selecting distinct flight IDs departing from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Wednesday, ensuring that the flights offer a meal. We are ordering by departure time in descending order to get the latest flight and limiting the results to one row to capture only the latest flight. Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for Wednesday's date for the query to work correctly.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the cost of flight UA 201 from Boston to Denver and flight UA 343 from Boston to Denver, you would need to query the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables alongside `FARE` to match the specific flights and their costs. Below is the SQL statement that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN 
    FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
WHERE 
    FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER IN (201, 343) 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
        FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
        WHERE CITY_CODE IN (
            SELECT CITY_CODE 
            FROM CITY 
            WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
        )
    ) 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
        FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
        WHERE CITY_CODE IN (
            SELECT CITY_CODE 
            FROM CITY 
            WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DENVER'
        )
    );
```

### Explanation:
- We use `JOIN` to combine the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables.
- We filter the results to select flights belonging to airline 'UA' with the specific flight numbers (201 and 343).
- To ensure we're looking at flights coming from Boston and going to Denver, we check the corresponding `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` using subqueries that retrieve airport codes for both cities. 

This SQL will return the flight IDs along with their respective round trip costs for the specified flights from Boston to Denver.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about the ground transportation options available from the Pittsburgh airport to downtown, along with their costs, you would typically reference the appropriate tables in your database schema. Below is the SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- It joins the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter the services based on the Pittsburgh airport.
- The condition `WHERE AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'` ensures that the results are specific to ground transportation from the Pittsburgh airport.

This will give you a list of available ground transportation options and their associated costs for getting to downtown from Pittsburgh airport.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH';

Raw LLM Response:
To list all nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh that arrive before 17:00 on Tuesday, the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '17:00'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming "STOPS" is the column denoting the number of stops
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joining Tables**: The query joins the necessary tables, including `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, the `CITY` table to match city names, the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flight information, and `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` for date and day matching.
2. **City Filtering**: It filters for flights departing from "LOS ANGELES" and arriving at "PITTSBURGH".
3. **Day and Time Filtering**: It checks that the flight's departure happens on a Tuesday and arrives before 17:00.
4. **Nonstop Filter**: The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` ensures that only nonstop flights are returned.
5. **Distinct Results**: The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that duplicate flight IDs are not included in the final results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from LAS VEGAS to NEW YORK operated by airline TW (Trans World Airlines) along with their fare information, you can make use of the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0

  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "TW"
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs along with their respective one-way and round-trip costs.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to ensure the relationships between cities, airports, and fares are correctly linked.
- The conditions restrict results to flights departing from LAS VEGAS to NEW YORK that are nonstop (i.e., `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0`) and operated by TW (Trans World Airlines).
- The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that duplicate entries are not shown in the results.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest round trip fare from Atlanta (ATL) to Baltimore/Washington International (BWI), you would need to write a SQL query that joins the relevant tables, including city and airport information alongside fare costs. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Lowest_Round_Trip_Fare
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming this field indicates if a round trip is needed
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` tables to access relevant information about the cities and fares.
2. **City Conditions**: It filters for flights originating from ATLANTA and going to BALTIMORE.
3. **Minimum Cost**: It uses `MIN(FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST)` to get the lowest round trip fare.
4. **Round Trip Requirement**: The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that only round-trip fares are considered.

Make sure to replace `'BALTIMORE'` with `'BWI'` if needed, as BWI is the airport code rather than city name.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest non-stop flight from WASHINGTON to SAN FRANCISCO on a Friday, you will need to join the relevant tables to filter for the specified cities, day of the week, and flight details. This would typically involve checking for flights without any stops (i.e., `STOPS = 0`). Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
       AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "FRIDAY")
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs and departure times for flights.
- It filters for flights departing from WASHINGTON to SAN FRANCISCO.
- It makes sure that there are no stops (`STOPS = 0`).
- It matches the day as Friday by checking against the `DAYS` table.
- The results are ordered by departure time to get the earliest flight, and the query limits the results to just 1 to return the earliest flight.

Question: i need an early flight from MILWAUKEE to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find an early flight from Milwaukee to Denver, you would typically want to select flights that depart from the airport serving Milwaukee and arrive at the airport serving Denver. Assuming you're looking for flights regardless of the day, we'll select the earliest departure time for the flights.

Here’s how you can formulate the SQL query for that requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to correlate airports with their respective cities (Milwaukee and Denver).
- **Filter with city names**: The WHERE clause filters the records to get the respective airport codes based on city names.
- **Flight information**: The query checks for flights going from Milwaukee's airport to Denver's airport.
- **Order and limit**: It orders the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order, and the `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the earliest flight is returned. 

Adjust the table/column names as necessary depending on your actual schema if there's any variation.

Raw LLM Response:
Certainly! To list the afternoon flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE, we need to set a time range that typically defines "afternoon" (for example, from 12:00 PM to 5:59 PM). Below is the SQL query that retrieves such flights:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '18:00:00';
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the airport codes for ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE.
- Filters the flights to only include those departing from ST. PETERSBURG to CHARLOTTE.
- Additionally filters the flights based on the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to include only those in the afternoon hours.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Chicago to Kansas City in the morning, you would need to filter the flight results based on the departure time, typically defined as early morning hours (for example, between 5:00 and 12:00). Here is the SQL query you can use to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '05:00:00'  -- Start of morning
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';   -- End of morning
```

This query joins the necessary tables to find flights from Chicago to Kansas City, filtering out those flights that depart in the morning hours. Adjust the time ranges as appropriate for your morning definition.

Raw LLM Response:
To find morning flights from Baltimore to Newark, you will want to query the relevant tables that hold information about flights, airports, and cities. A typical morning time range could be between 5:00 AM and 12:00 PM. The SQL query you would use might look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '05:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '12:00:00';
```

This query will return the unique flight IDs for all flights departing from Baltimore to Newark in the specified morning range. Make sure the table and column names match exactly as defined in your database schema. Adjust the time format if needed based on how it's stored in your database.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation:

1. **FROM Clause**: The query pulls data from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables, linking them by city and airport codes.

2. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights from MEMPHIS (`CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS"`).
   - Filters for flights to NEW YORK (`CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"`).
   - Checks that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` of the flights is during the morning (between 6 AM and 11:59 AM).

This will provide the IDs of flights departing from MEMPHIS to NEW YORK in the morning.

To get flights from LOS ANGELES to CHARLOTTE early in the morning, you can query the database to find flights departing from the airport in LOS ANGELES to the airport in CHARLOTTE, filtering for early morning hours (typically before 12 PM). Here's the SQL statement for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We join on the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both LOS ANGELES and CHARLOTTE using their respective `CITY_CODE`.
- We filter for flights from the airport code associated with LOS ANGELES to the airport code associated with CHARLOTTE.
- Finally, we check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before noon (12:00:00) to ensure we get early morning flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find morning flights from Newark to Los Angeles, you'll first want to identify what is considered a "morning" flight. Typically, morning flights can be defined as those departing before 12 PM (noon). 

Here’s the SQL query that captures the required information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs for flights departing from Newark to Los Angeles, filtering for departures before noon. Adjust the `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition as needed if your definition of "morning" differs.

Raw LLM Response:
To find evening flights from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES, we can assume "evening" typically refers to flights departing after 6 PM (18:00) for this query. Therefore, we will join the respective tables and filter by the departure time and city conditions.

Here is the SQL query for your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '18:00:00';
```

This query will give you the unique flight IDs of all evening flights departing from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES. Note that you might need to adjust the time format based on your database settings.

Raw LLM Response:
To get a one-way ticket from Milwaukee to Orlando for either Wednesday evening or Thursday morning, you'll need to specify the respective days and the appropriate time frame. Below is the SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
    AND (
        (DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00') OR

    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0;
```

### Explanation:
- The query uses **Airport Service** tables to map cities to their respective airports.
- It checks if the city names match "MILWAUKEE" and "ORLANDO".
- It filters flights based on the day of the week and the specified times for "Wednesday evening" (after 5 PM) or "Thursday morning" (before noon).
- **DATE_DAY** and **DAYS** tables are used to identify the specific day for the flights.
- Assumes `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` variables are set to the respective date for the search criteria. Adjust those based on your implementation.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID IN ( SELECT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FARE AS FAREalias0 WHERE ( FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of all round trip flights from BURBANK to SEATTLE that arrive before 1900 in SEATTLE, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '19:00'
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Key Points Explained:
- **AIRPORT_SERVICE** is used to identify the airports corresponding to BURBANK and SEATTLE.
- **CITY** is joined to get their respective city codes.
- We check for round trip flights by ensuring the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is marked (assuming 'Y' implies it is required).
- We filter for flights that arrive in SEATTLE before 1900 by checking the `ARRIVAL_TIME` of the flights.
- Using `DISTINCT` ensures that we only get unique flight IDs in our results. 

Make sure the fields align with your actual data types (i.e., ensure that the time is compared correctly).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve both FIRST class and COACH flights between JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and ORLANDO (presumably Orlando International Airport), you can use a SQL query that accounts for the different classes of service. Below is a query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
    CITY AS CITYalias0, 
    CITY AS CITYalias1, 
    FARE AS FAREalias0, 
    FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0, 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
    AND (FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST" OR FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH")
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Table Joins**: 
   - Joins the relevant tables to filter flights between New York (JFK) and Orlando based on city names.
   
2. **Flight Filtering**: 
   - Filters the flights based on departing and arriving airport codes derived from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
   
3. **Class of Service**: 
   - The query specifies that it needs to include only the flights where `CLASS_TYPE` is either "FIRST" or "COACH".

Make sure to replace "NEW YORK" and "ORLANDO" with the exact city names if they differ or ensure that you have the accurate city codes if required.

Question: show me the FIRST class and COACH flights from JFK airport to MIAMI
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID IN ( SELECT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FARE AS FAREalias0 WHERE ( ( FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN ( SELECT FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE FROM FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 WHERE FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST" ) ) OR ( FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN ( SELECT FARE_BASISalias1.FARE_BASIS_CODE FROM FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias1 WHERE FARE_BASISalias1.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "JFK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show FIRST class and COACH flights from JFK airport to MIAMI, you can combine the relevant tables to retrieve the necessary information while filtering by the specific service classes. Here’s the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
JOIN FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 ON FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
WHERE FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE IN ("FIRST", "COACH");
```

### Explanation of SQL Query:
- **FROM and JOINS**: Start by joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the relevant airport codes for JFK and MIAMI. Then join `CITY` for the city names.
- **FLIGHT Table**: Use the `FLIGHT` table to filter by flights originating from the JFK airport and heading to the MIAMI airport.
- **Flight Fare Information**: Include `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to connect flights to their fare details and filter by class types.
- **WHERE Clause**: The WHERE clause filters for flights with class types of either "FIRST" or "COACH".

Make sure to replace "NEW YORK" in the city filtering section if the exact city code or name for the JFK airport is needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the FIRST class and COACH flights from JFK to MIAMI, you can query the necessary tables looking for flights that match the specified criteria. Here's an SQL statement that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "JFK" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
    AND (FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST" OR FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH") 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: This query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to gather all necessary data about flights.
2. **City Filters**: It filters the results to only include flights from "JFK" to "MIAMI".
3. **Class Type Filter**: It restricts the selection to flights that are classified as "FIRST" or "COACH".
4. **DISTINCT**: The use of `DISTINCT` ensures that each flight ID appears only once in the results. 

You might need to replace `"JFK"` and `"MIAMI"` with their corresponding airport codes if they are stored differently in the database.

Question: are meals ever served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if meals are served on flights with a specific flight number or code, in this context "FF," you would typically join the relevant tables to check for meal service based on the specified flight. The `MEAL_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table can be important to see if any meals (from the `FOOD_SERVICE` table) are associated with that flight. Below is an SQL query that can help determine if meals are served on flights that have the flight number "FF":

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = 'FF';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT**: This table contains details about the flights, including `MEAL_CODE`.
2. **FOOD_SERVICE**: This table provides details about the meals served, which can be linked via `MEAL_CODE`.
3. The query retrieves descriptions of meals served for all flights with the airline flight number "FF."

This should help you check if any meals are served on that specific flight, assuming your database contains relevant information.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = 'FF';

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To find the airports associated with the cities Charlotte and Las Vegas.
   - `CITY`: To identify the related city codes.
   - `FLIGHT`: To link the flights departing from Charlotte to those arriving in Las Vegas.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To connect the flights to their respective fares.
   - `FARE`: To retrieve fare details.

2. **Selection Criteria**:
   - The query selects distinct fare IDs alongside the one-way and round-trip costs.
   - It finds flights from Charlotte to Las Vegas using the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns.

3. **Minimizing Fare**:
   - A subquery is used to find the minimum one-way cost between Charlotte and Las Vegas.

This query effectively retrieves the cheapest fare from Charlotte to Las Vegas, considering both one-way and round-trip options.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the lowest fares from WASHINGTON to SALT LAKE CITY, you can write the following SQL query. This query will look for the fares from the relevant airports and will return the minimum fare amounts:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID
ORDER BY FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC; -- or FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST ASC depending on which fare you're interested in
```

This query joins the relevant tables to find the cheapest one-way or round-trip fares between WASHINGTON and SALT LAKE CITY. It will return a list of fare IDs along with their costs, sorted in ascending order to show the lowest fares at the top. Adjust the `ORDER BY` clause based on whether you're looking for one-way or round-trip fares.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest fare from BWI (Baltimore/Washington International Airport) to Salt Lake City, you would want to join the relevant tables to access the fare information, along with the airport service details linking BWI and Salt Lake City. Here’s a suitable SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Lowest_Fare
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "BWI"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the minimum fare (one-way cost) from the `FARE` table.
- It joins multiple tables:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both the departure and destination cities.
  - `CITY` to filter by city names.
  - `FLIGHT` to link the flight information.
  - `FLIGHT_FARE` to connect fare details to flights.
- The WHERE clause filters for the specific airports and cities, ensuring only the relevant data is used to compute the lowest fare. 

Feel free to adjust city names or other parameters as needed!

Question: what ground transportation is available from LGA airport into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the available ground transportation options from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) into New York City, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = 'NEW YORK';
```

In this query:
- We select distinct transport types and their corresponding fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter the transportation services specifically available from LaGuardia Airport (LGA).
- The condition checks that the ground services offered are intended for the city coded as "NEW YORK". 

Please ensure that the `CITY_CODE` for "NEW YORK" is accurate based on your database's schema. Depending on your setup, the `CITY_CODE` might need to be retrieved first from the `CITY` table if it is not known.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights on MONDAY that travel from CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA to PHOENIX, ARIZONA, the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
      AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE = "NC"  -- Assuming NC is the state code for North Carolina
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
      AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE = "AZ"  -- Assuming AZ is the state code for Arizona
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join with AIRPORT_SERVICE**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both CHARLOTTE and PHOENIX to get their corresponding airport codes.
2. **Join with CITY**: It uses the `CITY` table to ensure we're looking at the correct cities and states.
3. **Filter for Day**: The `DAYS` table is utilized to filter for flights that operate on Monday.
4. **Select Statements**: It selects distinct flight IDs that meet all specified conditions. 

Make sure to adjust the state codes (like "NC" for North Carolina and "AZ" for Arizona) as per your database setup if they differ.

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "TEXAS" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the nonstop flights between San Jose and Houston, Texas, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'SAN JOSE' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'HOUSTON' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming 'STOPS' indicates the number of stops, where 0 means nonstop
```

### Explanation:

- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find airports corresponding to San Jose and Houston.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` ensures that only nonstop flights (with zero stops) are returned. Adjust this condition based on how stops are tracked in your schema (e.g., if there's a specific column for nonstop flights).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

Raw LLM Response:
To find American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark to Nashville around 6:30 PM, you'll want to select flights with the specified departure city, arrival city, airline code, and a departure time that is close to 6:30 PM.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '18:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` to filter for flights departing from Newark and arriving in Nashville.
- It specifies that the airline code must be "AA" for American Airlines.
- The `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition checks if the flight departs between 6:00 PM (18:00:00) and 6:59 PM (18:59:59), which encompasses the time around 6:30 PM.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip flight from Los Angeles to Tacoma, Washington with a stopover in San Francisco, not exceeding a price of $300 for the date 6/10/1993, we can construct an SQL query that incorporates the necessary tables and conditions based on your schema. Here’s how you might write the query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias2,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA"
  AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE = CITYalias2.CITY_CODE

  -- From Los Angeles to San Francisco
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE

  -- From San Francisco to Tacoma
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
     SELECT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID
     FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
     WHERE FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE
       AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  )

  -- Matching the date
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 10
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 6
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = 1993
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE

  -- Checking for round-trip fare not exceeding 300
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST <= 300;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Selecting Distinct Flight IDs:** We are using `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique flight IDs.

2. **Joining Necessary Tables:** The query joins several tables, including `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE`, which are necessary to link cities, flights, and fares.

3. **City Checks:** The `WHERE` clause checks if the city names match the ones specified for Los Angeles (departure), San Francisco (stopover), and Tacoma (destination).

4. **Flight Paths:** The first part of the flight is from Los Angeles to San Francisco. We check if there is a matching leg from San Francisco to Tacoma to ensure it's a round trip with a stop.

5. **Date Condition:** We set the date for the flight to be June 10, 1993, and check the days.

6. **Fare Condition:** Lastly, it ensures the round-trip fare does not exceed $300.

This should provide the required round-trip flight options that meet the criteria specified. Adjust the table names and attributes to match the exact format of your database if needed.
