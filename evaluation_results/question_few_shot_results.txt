Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Denver to Salt Lake City specifically on a Monday, you would need to join the necessary tables to gather data on flights while specifying the required cities and the day of the week. Here’s how the SQL query could be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
       CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND 
       CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
       CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND 
       FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
       FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) AND 
      DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" AND 
      FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs where the following conditions hold:
  - The city code for Denver matches the airport service for departures.
  - The city code for Salt Lake City matches the airport service for arrivals.
  - The flight is indeed from Denver to Salt Lake City.
  - The day name matches "MONDAY", ensuring that we identify flights that operate on that specific day of the week.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from MILWAUKEE to SAN JOSE on Wednesday, you would need to join the relevant tables and filter by the day of the week. Here is a query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- We select distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, and `DAYS` tables to filter flights that go from Milwaukee to San Jose.
- We specify that we are interested in flights on Wednesday by checking that `DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME` is "WEDNESDAY". 
- The flight's days are matched against the associated code in the `FLIGHT` table. 

Make sure to adjust the SQL query depending on your actual database schema and naming conventions if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS on a Monday, you'll want to construct a SQL query similar to the previous examples. Below is an SQL query that would retrieve that data based on the provided schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We're joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, and `FLIGHT` tables.
- We're filtering for flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS.
- We specify the requirement that the day should be Monday by checking against the `DAYS` table and ensuring that the `FLIGHT` has a matching `FLIGHT_DAYS` code for Monday.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Miami to Indianapolis specifically on Sunday, you can write an SQL query that joins the necessary tables and applies the condition for the specific day (Sunday). You will check that the departure cities match MIAMI and INDIANAPOLIS, and filter the flights based on the day code for Sunday.

Here’s how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY";
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Joined**:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` twice for the departure and arrival cities.
  - `CITY` twice to filter based on city names.
  - `FLIGHT` for the actual flight data.
  - `DAYS` to filter flights based on the specified day (Sunday).

- **Conditions**:
  - Filter the flight by `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` corresponding to Miami and Indianapolis, respectively.
  - Ensure that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` matches with the day code for Sunday. 

This query will return distinct flight IDs for flights from Miami to Indianapolis operating on Sundays.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the flights from LOS ANGELES to PITTSBURGH on Tuesday, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"

  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "TUESDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs for flights departing from LOS ANGELES to PITTSBURGH on Tuesday. It joins the relevant tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, DATE_DAY, DAYS, and FLIGHT) to filter out the necessary information based on city names and days of the week. Make sure that the day name matches appropriately with the entries in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain a Friday flight from NEWARK to TAMPA, you would want to join the necessary tables to retrieve the flights based on the specified criteria. Here's how your SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "FRIDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Join**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to correlate the flight availability with the respective city and day.
2. **City Filters**: The query specifically filters for flights departing from "NEWARK" and arriving at "TAMPA".
3. **Day Filter**: The query checks for flights that operate on "FRIDAY".
4. **Distinct Results**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate flight records are not returned. 

Make sure to replace `"NEWARK"` and `"TAMPA"` with the actual city names as they appear in your database if they differ.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY";
```

This query performs the following operations:

1. It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to identify the airport codes corresponding to TAMPA and CHARLOTTE.
2. It further joins these results with the `FLIGHT` and `DAYS` tables to filter for flights available on Sunday.
3. Finally, it selects the distinct flight IDs that meet the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the available flights from INDIANAPOLIS to ORLANDO on December 27, you'll want to structure your SQL query similarly to the previous examples. However, since no specific time frame is given, the query will simply retrieve all flights for that day. Below is the SQL statement for your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 27 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace year0 with the actual year you are querying for
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

Raw LLM Response:
To find available flights from Milwaukee to Phoenix on Saturday, the SQL query would need to join the relevant tables, filter based on the cities, and ensure the flights are on the specified day (Saturday). Here’s the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
JOIN DAYS AS DAYSalias0 ON DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY"
WHERE DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME;
```

Please note that the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables are joined to ensure that the query is filtering for flights specifically on Saturday. Adjust the query according to the actual names and structure of your database if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from PHOENIX to MILWAUKEE on Wednesday, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you have the necessary date information (like month and day of the month) in the variables `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0`, similar to the previous queries.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY";
```

In the above query, replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values that represent the date you are querying for Wednesday flights. The `DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY"` condition ensures that you are filtering for flights specifically on Wednesday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights between MEMPHIS and CINCINNATI on Wednesday, you will need to join the relevant tables to get the necessary details. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We retrieve distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the necessary tables to link the cities to their respective airports.
- We filter for flights that depart from MEMPHIS and arrive in CINCINNATI specifically on Wednesday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Kansas City to Chicago on a specific date (June 16), you will need to reference the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `DATE_DAY` tables to ensure you're filtering the data correctly based on your criteria.

Here's an SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 16 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **City Codes**: The query joins both `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to get the airport codes for Kansas City and Chicago.
2. **Filtering by Date**: The `DATE_DAY` table is used to ensure the flights are from June 16 of the specified year.
3. **Flight Availability**: The query checks the flight days against the corresponding day names, ensuring only flights available on that specific date are returned. 

**Note:** Replace `year0` with the actual year you want to filter for. For example, if you are looking for flights on June 16, 2023, you would replace `year0` with `2023`.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the flights from Chicago to Kansas City on June 17, you'll want to follow the structure of the previous SQL queries while considering the specific date. Assuming June 17 is represented by a particular month number and year, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 17 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- Replace `year0` with the actual year you are checking the flights for.
- This SQL query selects distinct flight IDs from flights originating in Chicago and heading to Kansas City, specifically on June 17, taking into account the relevant date details from the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables.

To list all the flights from KANSAS CITY to CHICAGO on June 16, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query, you will need to replace `year0` with the appropriate year you are inquiring about. This retrieves all distinct flight IDs that match the criteria for flights between KANSAS CITY and CHICAGO on the specified date.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the flights from Chicago to Kansas City on June 17, you would first want to use the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `DATE_DAY` tables. Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 17 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined twice to get the airport codes for both Chicago and Kansas City.
2. The `CITY` table is used to match the city names with their respective codes.
3. The `DATE_DAY` table is used to filter for flights specifically on June 17.
4. The `DAYS` table helps to ensure that the flight days align with the desired date.
5. The `FLIGHT` table contains the actual flights which correspond to the selected airports in Chicago and Kansas City.

Adjust the date as necessary or query any additional fields as needed per your requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights available from KANSAS CITY to CHICAGO next Wednesday, you'd typically need to know the date of next Wednesday, as well as the time of travel. However, based on the provided schema, here’s a SQL query template that you can use to retrieve the relevant flights for that trip.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE) 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:

- You would need to populate `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` based on the date of next Wednesday. 
- `DAYS_CODE` from the `DAYS` table should correspond to the code associated with Wednesday in your dataset.

Please replace the placeholders with the actual values relevant to your query in order to get the appropriate results.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from PHOENIX to DETROIT on Monday, you would construct an SQL query that retrieves flight information based on the specified criteria. Here's how the query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "Monday" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: Joins the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `DATE_DAY`, and `DAYS`) to access all required fields.
- **WHERE Clause**: This specifies the conditions:
  - The origin city is PHOENIX.
  - The destination city is DETROIT.
  - The flight's departure airport corresponds to the airport in PHOENIX, and the arrival airport corresponds to DETROIT.
  - The day of the flight must be Monday. 

This will return a list of unique flight IDs from PHOENIX to DETROIT that are scheduled for Monday.

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query for finding flights from DETROIT to SAN DIEGO on Tuesday, you will need to join the relevant tables for airports, cities, flights, and flight days. Assuming that the day name for Tuesday corresponds to the DAY_NAME stored in the DAYS table, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "TUESDAY";
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `DAYS` tables to gather all necessary information.
- We filter based on the city names for DETROIT and SAN DIEGO.
- We check for flights that are operational on TUESDAY by matching the `FLIGHT_DAYS` to the `DAYS_CODE`.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from CINCINNATI to SAN JOSE on a Monday, you can utilize the same structure used in the previous queries. You would join the relevant tables, filter based on the departure city and destination, and ensure that the flight is available on the specified day (Monday). Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE);
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID`s from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter for specific airports in CINCINNATI and SAN JOSE.
- The `DAYS` table is used to ensure that the flights are available on Monday, which is specified by filtering `DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME` to "MONDAY".

In this query:
- We're joining airport services with the cities to identify the correct airport codes for SAN JOSE and HOUSTON.
- We're also using the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables to filter for flights that operate on Wednesday. 
- Finally, we retrieve the distinct flight IDs that match all the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Houston to Memphis on Friday, you can structure your SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON"
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS"
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
                              AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
JOIN DAYS AS DAYSalias0 ON DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "FRIDAY";
```

### Explanation:
- The query looks for flights from **HOUSTON** to **MEMPHIS**.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the airport codes for both cities.
- It checks the flight details in the `FLIGHT` table by matching the airport codes.
- It includes the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables to ensure that the flight is specifically available on **Friday**.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that you only get unique flight IDs in the result.

Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from BURBANK to TACOMA on a specific date (6/10), you will need to follow these guidelines in your SQL statement. The focus will be on identifying the appropriate airport service for both cities, the date, and the flights available on that day.

Here's how the SQL query can be constructed:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 10 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- Replace with the specific year you are interested in
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Flights**: The query selects distinct flight IDs.
2. **Joining Tables**: It involves joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to gather the necessary information.
3. **Filtering by City**: It matches BURBANK and TACOMA through their respective city codes.
4. **Date Matching**: Filters for flights specifically on June 10 of a given year (the exact year needs to be specified).
5. **Day Matching**: Ensures that the flight days match the corresponding day of the week.

Make sure to replace `year0` in the query with the actual year for June 10 that you are interested in querying.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights from WASHINGTON to BOSTON that leave on a Saturday, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables and applies the necessary conditions to filter for the specified cities and day of the week:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
                FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"

      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs and other relevant information from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `DAYS` tables to filter for flights departing from WASHINGTON to BOSTON.
- The query specifies that the departure day must be a Saturday by checking that the `DAY_NAME` equals "SATURDAY".

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL specifically on a SATURDAY, the SQL query would look similar to the previous queries, incorporating the appropriate `DAYS` and `FLIGHT` tables to ensure the flight days are filtered correctly. Here's how the SQL would be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY";
```

### Explanation:
- **Join Condition**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to link cities to their respective airport codes. 
- **City Conditions**: It filters for flights departing from WASHINGTON and arriving at MONTREAL.
- **Days Condition**: It checks that the flight operates on SATURDAY by matching `FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS` to the corresponding `DAYS.DAYS_CODE` for SATURDAY.
- **Distinct Flight IDs**: The query retrieves distinct flight IDs for the matching conditions. 

Make sure the city names and the DAY_NAME for SATURDAY are correct according to your database entries. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the actual case sensitivity or structure of your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To list Saturday flights from Washington to Boston, the SQL query needs to select flights where the departure airport is in Washington and the arrival airport is in Boston, while also filtering the flights that are available on Saturdays. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY";
```

In this query:
- We are using `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to relate the cities to their respective airports.
- We are filtering for flights from Washington to Boston.
- We ensure that the flight days match with the day of the week "SATURDAY" using the `DAYS` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from DALLAS to PHOENIX, you would need to use a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to get the necessary information about flights going from the DALLAS airport (whose airport code is assumed to be "DAL") to the PHOENIX airport. You'll also need to find the relevant AIRPORT_SERVICE for the cities involved. Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

In this query:
- The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table provides the mapping between cities and their respective airports.
- The `CITY` table is joined to filter for flights from DALLAS to PHOENIX.
- Finally, the `FLIGHT` table is used to pull the flight IDs for successful connections from the DALLAS airport to the PHOENIX airport. 

Make sure to replace "DALLAS" and "PHOENIX" with the actual city names as defined in your `CITY` table if there are any discrepancies.

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves the flight ID, airline details (code and flight number), departure and arrival times, the number of stops, and the time elapsed for flights.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter for the specific cities (Salt Lake City and Phoenix).
- The `FLIGHT` table is then used to find the flights based on the origin and destination airport codes derived from the city names.

Question: could i have flight information on flights from PITTSBURGH to PHOENIX please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights from PITTSBURGH to PHOENIX, you will join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both cities, the `CITY` table to identify the cities, and the `FLIGHT` table to get the flight details. Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
       FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.STOPS, 
       FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS, FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX'
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
                             AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This will provide you with the distinct flight IDs, airline codes, flight numbers, departure and arrival times, number of stops, flight days, and total travel time for flights originating from PITTSBURGH and heading to PHOENIX. Adjust the selected fields according to the specific flight information you need.

To retrieve flights from Detroit to Toronto, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

This query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to find all the flights available from Detroit to Toronto. Adjust the city names if needed based on the actual names used in your database.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from TORONTO to MILWAUKEE, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

This query does the following:
- It selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the appropriate airports for both cities (TORONTO and MILWAUKEE).
- It checks that the flights are departing from the airport associated with TORONTO and arriving at the airport associated with MILWAUKEE.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Cleveland to Dallas, you can follow a structure similar to the previous SQL queries you've provided. Here's the SQL statement you might use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the related tables to filter for flights based on the provided cities.
- Two `AIRPORT_SERVICE` entries are used to map Cleveland and Dallas' respective airport codes from the `CITY` table.
- It checks both the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` against the appropriate airport codes.

Make sure you run this SQL query in your database environment to get the specific flight details from Cleveland to Dallas.

Question: i need information on flights from INDIANAPOLIS to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights from INDIANAPOLIS to SEATTLE, we would write a SQL query that identifies the relevant airports, retrieves the necessary flight data based on departures from the airport in INDIANAPOLIS and arrivals at the airport in SEATTLE. Here's how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- `FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`: This gets the airport services related to INDIANAPOLIS.
- `FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`: This gets the airport services related to SEATTLE.
- `FROM CITY AS CITYalias0`: This refers to the city data for INDIANAPOLIS.
- `FROM CITY AS CITYalias1`: This refers to the city data for SEATTLE.
- `FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0`: This references the flight information.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the data to ensure we're only getting flights that depart from INDIANAPOLIS and arrive in SEATTLE.

This should give you a list of available flights with relevant details.

Question: i need flight information from MILWAUKEE to TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Milwaukee to Tampa, you need to join the relevant tables (like AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, and FLIGHT) to get the details of flights available for the specified route. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
1. **FROM Clause**: This part defines the tables being used and their relationships.
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Milwaukee and Tampa to get their corresponding airport codes.
   - `CITY` for both cities to ensure we're looking at the correct destination and departure locations.
   - `FLIGHT` to get flight information related to the airport codes.

2. **WHERE Clause**: This part specifies the conditions that must be met:
   - Matching cities to ensure we are querying the correct routes.
   - Matching the flight's `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` to the service airport codes derived from the respective city.

3. **SELECT Clause**: This selects distinct flight IDs and additional relevant flight details of interest, such as departure and arrival times, airline code, and flight number.

This query provides a good overview of the available flights from Milwaukee to Tampa. Adjust the SELECT fields as necessary depending on the specific flight details you want to obtain.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO, you would typically want to include details such as flight IDs, departure times, arrival times, and possibly the airlines providing the flights. Below is an SQL query that addresses this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1, FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight information from the flights table.
- It joins the necessary tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY) to filter flights based on the originating city (TORONTO) and the destination city (SAN DIEGO).
- It retrieves the flight ID, departure time, arrival time, and the airline code for each flight matched by the specified conditions.

To retrieve information on flights from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO, you can use the following SQL query. This query will pull data from the relevant tables within the database schema provided to find the available flights based on the specified cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs along with additional details like the airline code, flight number, departure time, arrival time, and time elapsed.
- It uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find the airport codes for both TORONTO and SAN DIEGO based on their city names.
- Then, it retrieves the flights that correspond to those airports. 

You can customize the selected fields as needed based on what information you require about the flights.

To retrieve all flights from ORLANDO to MONTREAL, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"

Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Indianapolis to Memphis, we can follow a similar structure to the previous queries by joining the necessary tables and filtering based on city names. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table where the departure airport corresponds to Indianapolis and the destination airport corresponds to Memphis. The airport services for each city are joined appropriately to get the correct airport codes.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from St. Petersburg to Detroit using the database schema provided, you would need to utilize the relevant tables—specifically `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`. The SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `CITY` table to find the appropriate `CITY_CODE` for "ST. PETERSBURG" and "DETROIT".
- Uses `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to relate each city to their respective airport codes.
- Selects `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table where the FROM and TO airports match the airports identified in the previous steps. 

Remember to execute this query against your database to retrieve the desired flight information.

Question: show me all flights from SAN JOSE to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from SAN JOSE to PHOENIX, you can use a query that joins the relevant tables to ensure that you are filtering for flights from the correct departure and arrival airports. Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This selects the distinct flight IDs from the results.
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1, FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0**: This indicates the tables being utilized in the query along with their aliases.
- **WHERE conditions**: The conditions ensure that:
  - The city code matches for SAN JOSE and PHOENIX in the respective airport services.
  - The flight is correctly filtered based on the departure airport (from SAN JOSE) and the arrival airport (to PHOENIX).

This query will return all available flights from SAN JOSE to PHOENIX.

Question: list flights from CHICAGO to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To create a SQL query that lists flights from Chicago to San Diego, similar to the previous queries mentioned, you would join the relevant tables for airport services and flights. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs where the flight departs from Chicago and arrives in San Diego, by checking against the airport service data for both cities. It uses the AIRPORT_SERVICE table to find the airports associated with each city and the FLIGHT table to get the relevant flights.

Question: list flights from DENVER to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Denver to Phoenix, you would want to join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables along with the `FLIGHT` table to get the relevant data. Here is the SQL query to retrieve that information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query performs the following actions:
- It selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table, ensuring you get unique flight entries.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to match the source city (Denver) with its corresponding airport code and the destination city (Phoenix) with its airport code.
- Finally, it filters the flights to only include those that are departing from Denver and arriving in Phoenix.

Question: list flights from LAS VEGAS to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from LAS VEGAS to SAN DIEGO, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both LAS VEGAS and SAN DIEGO to obtain the corresponding airport codes.
- It uses the `CITY` table to match the city names with their respective codes.
- Finally, it filters the `FLIGHT` table based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` matching LAS VEGAS's airport code and the `TO_AIRPORT` matching SAN DIEGO's airport code.

Question: list flights from HOUSTON to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from HOUSTON to MILWAUKEE, you would want to join the relevant tables together to find the flights that operate from the airport serving HOUSTON to the airport serving MILWAUKEE. Here’s how you could write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query performs the following tasks:
- Selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice: once for HOUSTON and once for MILWAUKEE.
- Joins the `CITY` table twice to filter based on the city names.
- Filters the criteria to find flights from the HOUSTON airport to the MILWAUKEE airport.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from LOS ANGELES to ORLANDO, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes you're looking for flights departing from Los Angeles and arriving at Orlando, using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query identifies distinct flight IDs for all flights that are available from Los Angeles to Orlando by joining the relevant tables based on city names and airport codes. Adjust the table names or conditions as necessary based on your actual database schema or requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers for flights from HOUSTON to DALLAS, you can use a SQL query that joins the relevant tables. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query does the following:
- It selects distinct flight numbers from the FLIGHT table.
- It joins the AIRPORT_SERVICE table on the city names for HOUSTON and DALLAS.
- It filters the results based on the specified city names and matches the respective airport codes to find available flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights that leave from Philadelphia and go to Dallas, you can use the following SQL query, which joins the necessary tables to filter the flights based on the specified departure and destination cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to identify the correct airport codes associated with Philadelphia and Dallas.
- The `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields are matched with the corresponding airport codes to filter for the flights that leave from Philadelphia (PHILADELPHIA) and arrive in Dallas (DALLAS).

Question: show me the flights between HOUSTON and ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights between HOUSTON and ORLANDO, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the airport codes for HOUSTON and ORLANDO. It then retrieves the flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table that have departures from the HOUSTON airport and arrivals at the ORLANDO airport. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each flight ID is listed only once, even if there are multiple flights fitting the criteria.

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the flights between HOUSTON and ORLANDO, you would write the following SQL query that joins the necessary tables to find the flights based on the airports associated with those cities:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query selects the distinct flight IDs from flights where:
- The departure airport corresponds to HOUSTON (using the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables).
- The arrival airport corresponds to ORLANDO (also using the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables).
- The actual FLIGHT table is used to get the corresponding flights based on the identified airports.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the flights from HOUSTON to ORLANDO, you can use a SQL query that retrieves flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table by joining it with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables similar to the previous examples. The query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query will return all distinct flight IDs for flights going from HOUSTON to ORLANDO. It joins the necessary tables to ensure that the flights correspond to the specified origin and destination cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS, the SQL query would look similar to the previous queries used for finding flights. Here’s how you could structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs for flights that depart from MEMPHIS and arrive in LAS VEGAS, joining the necessary tables based on the city names and airport codes.

Question: what are the flights from ONTARIO to MEMPHIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Ontario to Memphis, you can structure your SQL query similarly to the previous ones. Here's how you can formulate your query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query does the following:
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables for both the departure city (Ontario) and the arrival city (Memphis) to get the associated airport codes.
- Filters the desired cities by their names.
- Using the `FLIGHT` table, it finds flights that go from the airport corresponding to Ontario to the airport corresponding to Memphis.

     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from TAMPA to MILWAUKEE, you can use the following SQL query. This query identifies the relevant cities and extracts the corresponding flight IDs based on the available routes between the two cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:

1. **FROM Clause**: The query joins multiple tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`) to gather all necessary information to find the flights.
  
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters the cities based on names "TAMPA" and "MILWAUKEE".
   - Ensures the `FROM_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT` table matches the `AIRPORT_CODE` for TAMPA and the `TO_AIRPORT` matches the `AIRPORT_CODE` for MILWAUKEE.
  
3. **SELECT DISTINCT**: Each selected flight ID is unique, avoiding duplication.

This query will yield the unique IDs of any flights available between TAMPA and MILWAUKEE.

To list the flights from LOS ANGELES to CHARLOTTE, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

Question: i'd like to travel from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE, you can use a SQL query similar to the ones provided in your examples. Here's the SQL query that selects distinct flight IDs for flights going from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query works as follows:
1. It selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both BURBANK and MILWAUKEE to find their respective airport codes.
3. It ensures that the selected flights are from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE using the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields in the `FLIGHT` table.

  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the flights from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE, you can use the following SQL query. It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to find flights originating from Burbank and destined for Milwaukee:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that the result set contains unique flight IDs.
- The query uses inner joins to connect the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to the `CITY` and `FLIGHT` tables, filtering for the correct cities.
- It specifies `BURBANK` as the departing city and `MILWAUKEE` as the arriving city, ensuring only relevant flights are selected.

Question: find me all the flights from MILWAUKEE to ST. LOUIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find all the flights from Milwaukee to St. Louis, you would need to use a SQL query that parallels the structure of the previous queries. The SQL query will leverage the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to map the cities to their corresponding airports and then query the `FLIGHT` table for the relevant flights. 

Here is how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This SQL query does the following:
- Selects distinct flight IDs.
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both Milwaukee and St. Louis to find their respective airport codes.
- Uses the `CITY` table to ensure we're only looking for flights originating from Milwaukee to St. Louis.
- Finally, it filters the `FLIGHT` table based on the from and to airport codes identified from the previous joins. 

Make sure to execute this query in the appropriate database context where these tables are defined.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from WASHINGTON to BOSTON, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables to find one-way fares based on the specified cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
       AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

This SQL query will give you the distinct fare IDs from WASHINGTON to BOSTON by joining the relevant airport and city information. If you want additional fare details (like costs), you can modify the SELECT statement to include more fields from the `FARE` table.

Question: get fares from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL, you'd need to join relevant tables such as `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FARE`. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL' 
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **Table Joins**:
   - The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined twice: once for WASHINGTON and once for MONTREAL.
   - The `CITY` table is joined to get the relevant city codes based on the given city names.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query checks that the entries in `CITY` match the specified city names "WASHINGTON" and "MONTREAL".
   - It then verifies that the `FROM_AIRPORT` in `FARE` matches the WASHINGTON airport code and the `TO_AIRPORT` matches the MONTREAL airport code.

3. **Select Statement**:
   - The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each fare is returned only once.
   - Selected fields include `FARE_ID`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` to provide useful fare information.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Boston to Orlando that stop in New York, you need to check for flights that have a departure from a Boston airport, arrive at a New York airport, and then continue to an Orlando airport. The SQL query for this scenario would look like the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias2, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
          SELECT FLIGHT_LEG.FLIGHT_ID 
          FROM FLIGHT_LEG 
          WHERE LEG_FLIGHT = (
              SELECT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_NUMBER 
              FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 
              WHERE FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
                    AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
          )
      );
```

### Explanation:
1. The main query selects distinct flight IDs (FLIGHT_ID) from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. It joins the necessary tables to filter flights that:
   - Depart from Boston (`CITY_NAME = "BOSTON"`).
   - Have a stop in New York (`CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"`).
   - Continue to Orlando (`CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"`).
3. The subquery checks for flight legs that represent a leg from Boston to New York ensuring that a stop in New York is encountered on the way to Orlando.

Make sure to replace `AIRPORT` and other service-specific identifiers with the appropriate codes or identifiers depending on your database design and naming conventions.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from MEMPHIS to TACOMA that goes through LOS ANGELES, you would want to look for a flight from MEMPHIS to LOS ANGELES and then from LOS ANGELES to TACOMA. The SQL query for this would combine details from the `FLIGHT` table while ensuring that the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` match the respective airports. 

Here’s how you might construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT1.FLIGHT_ID AS FIRST_FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHT2.FLIGHT_ID AS SECOND_FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHT1, FLIGHT AS FLIGHT2,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE1, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE2, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE3,
     CITY AS CITY1, CITY AS CITY2, CITY AS CITY3
WHERE CITY1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND CITY1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITY2.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES' AND CITY2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE2.CITY_CODE
  AND CITY3.CITY_NAME = 'TACOMA' AND CITY3.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE3.CITY_CODE
  AND FLIGHT1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE2.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT2.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE2.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT2.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE3.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight IDs for two flights: 
  - `FLIGHT1` for the segment from MEMPHIS to LOS ANGELES.
  - `FLIGHT2` for the segment from LOS ANGELES to TACOMA.
- The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined multiple times to find the correct airport codes for each city.
- The `CITY` table ensures we match the right cities to their corresponding airport services. 
- This will yield the flights that meet your specified routing criteria.

```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:

1. **Selecting Distinct Flight IDs**: We use `SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID` to avoid duplicate entries for the same flight.

2. **Joining Tables**:
   - We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for Ontario, Westchester County, and Chicago to obtain their corresponding city codes and airport codes.
   - `CITY` is used to look up names for cities.

3. **WHERE Conditions**:
   - We filter the results to flights that depart from Ontario and arrive at Westchester County.
   - We ensure that there is at least one stop (`FLIGHTalias0.STOPS > 0`).
   - We check that the stop is in Chicago by using a subquery that confirms Chicago is one of the airports along the flight's path. 

This SQL statement assumes that the table structures and relationships are as described in your schema. Make sure to adjust the city names according to how they are stored in your database.

``` 

### Explanation
1. This query finds flights from MEMPHIS (CITYalias0) to TACOMA (CITYalias2) that have a stop in LOS ANGELES (CITYalias1).
2. It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for each city to ensure it locates the right airport codes.
3. It filters the flights based on stop criteria, which indicates that the route includes a stop at the specified airport (LOS ANGELES). Adjustments might be necessary based on your specific database structure for stops or layovers.
4. The `FLIGHT.STOPS` attribute is used to signify the number of stops; in this case, we assume there is 1 stop. Modify based on your data requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To get all Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Montreal to Orlando, you would use a SQL query that selects flights based on the specified origin and destination, along with the condition that the airline is Delta Airlines. Based on the provided schema, here is how you might structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL";
```

### Explanation:
- **DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This ensures that each flight ID is unique in the results.
- **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: This table is used to get the airports for the cities Montreal and Orlando.
- **CITY**: This table helps identify the correct city codes for Montreal and Orlando.
- **FLIGHT**: This table contains the details of the flights, including the field `AIRLINE_CODE` which is checked to be "DL" for Delta Airlines.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the flights based on the selected cities and ensures that we're only looking for flights from Montreal to Orlando specifically for Delta Airlines.

Ensure you replace `"DL"` with the actual airline code if it differs in your database.

Question: flight numbers from CHICAGO to SEATTLE on CO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight numbers for flights from Chicago to Seattle operated by Continental Airlines (CO), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO";
```

This query performs the following actions:
1. Joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Chicago and Seattle to find the corresponding airports.
2. Joins the `CITY` table to confirm the city names.
3. Joins the `FLIGHT` table to find the flights between the two cities.
4. Filters the results to only include flights operated by Continental Airlines (identified by the airline code "CO").

Raw LLM Response:
To show Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Boston to Salt Lake City, you can construct an SQL query to retrieve the relevant flight information. Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL";
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **Selection of DISTINCT FLIGHT_ID**: We want unique flight identifiers.
- **Joining the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables**: This allows matching airport codes with their respective cities.
- **Filtering**: The query specifies the cities of interest ("BOSTON" and "SALT LAKE CITY").
- **Airline Code Filter**: The query filters by the airline code for Delta Airlines (DL).
- **FROM_AIRPORT and TO_AIRPORT**: These conditions ensure we are looking at flights departing from Boston to Salt Lake City. 

Make sure to replace any placeholder variables or additional filtering as needed based on your requirements or the specifics of your application.

Raw LLM Response:
To show Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Boston to Salt Lake City, you need to filter the flights by both the departing city (Boston) and the destination city (Salt Lake City), along with ensuring that the airline code corresponds to Delta Airlines (DL). Here is the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL";
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs from the FLIGHT table, joining it with the AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY tables to ensure that the flights are from Boston to Salt Lake City and belong to Delta Airlines.

Question: what are the AA flights from NEWARK to NASHVILLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark to Nashville, you will need to filter the flights by both the departure and arrival cities, as well as the airline code. Here's how that SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA";
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: This part joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to access necessary details about the flights and their respective airports.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - This specifies the starting city as "NEWARK" and the destination city as "NASHVILLE".
   - It filters the flights so that only those that depart from the Newark airport (found in `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0`) and arrive at the Nashville airport (found in `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`) are selected.
   - Finally, the query filters for flights operated by American Airlines by specifying `FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA"`.

You can execute this query against your database to get the desired results.

Question: is there TAXI service at the ONT airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "ONT" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "TAXI" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check if there is taxi service available at the ONT (Ontario International Airport) airport, you would need to look for any ground services listed for that airport, specifically checking for a transport type that indicates taxi service.

Here's how you might formulate the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
WHERE GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ONT' 
AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'TAXI';
```

This query selects distinct transport types from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table where the `AIRPORT_CODE` is 'ONT' and the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` is 'TAXI'. If there are any results returned, then taxi service is available; otherwise, it is not.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE 
WHERE GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ONT' 
AND GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'TAXI';

Question: how much is COACH flight from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fare for a COACH flight from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA, you can join the necessary tables to get the relevant information, such as the fare based on the AIRPORT_SERVICE, FARE, and FARE_BASIS tables. Here's a SQL query that would effectively accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = 'COACH'
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct fare IDs and one-way costs (`ONE_DIRECTION_COST`) for flights from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables using city names and checks if the fare basis corresponds to COACH class.
-Based on the requirements given, it filters the results to fetch the COACH class only.

Question: list airlines that fly from SEATTLE to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list airlines that fly from Seattle to Salt Lake City, you would need to query the database for flights connecting the two cities and then select the distinct airline codes or names associated with those flights. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     AIRLINE AS AIRLINE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME**: This selects distinct airline names to avoid duplicates in the result.
- **FROM and JOIN clauses**: We link the necessary tables together (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FLIGHT, and AIRLINE) using their related keys.
- **WHERE conditions**: These conditions filter the records to only include flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City. We check the city names and match them to their corresponding airport services and flights. We also ensure that the flights are associated with their respective airlines.

This query will return a list of unique airline names that operate flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights that go from NEW YORK to MIAMI and back, you need to retrieve the flights in both directions: from NEW YORK to MIAMI and from MIAMI back to NEW YORK. The SQL query below does this by joining the `FLIGHT` table on the specified conditions:

```sql
-- Flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE

UNION

-- Flights from MIAMI to NEW YORK
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The first part of the query retrieves flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI, ensuring that we check the proper airport codes and city names.
- The second part retrieves flights from MIAMI to NEW YORK under similar conditions.
- The `UNION` operator combines the results of both queries, ensuring distinct flight IDs are returned. 

### Note:
Adjustments can be made depending on your actual database schema and requirements, such as adding date filters if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal, you would want to select flights that depart from Orlando and return to Orlando, with a destination of Montreal. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND 
      CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND 
      CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND 
      CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND 
      FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
      FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND
      FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND 
      FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHTalias0` represents the outbound flight from Orlando to Montreal.
- `FLIGHTalias1` represents the return flight from Montreal to Orlando.
- Both cities are validated against their respective `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` records to ensure that we are working with the correct airports.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that we only get unique flight IDs. 

This query structure enables you to retrieve round-trip flights that fulfill the specified criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from BURBANK to SEATTLE using the provided database schema, you can construct an SQL query similar to the following one:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This clause selects unique flight IDs from the result set to avoid duplicates.
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS...**: Joins the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE`) to filter based on the origin and destination cities.
- **WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK'**: Filters for flights departing from BURBANK.
- **AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE'**: Filters for flights arriving at SEATTLE.
- **AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE**: Ensures that the flight's departure airport matches BURBANK's airport code.
- **AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE**: Ensures that the flight's arrival airport matches SEATTLE's airport code.
- **AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'**: Filters for fares that indicate a round trip is required.

Make sure to replace `'BURBANK'` and `'SEATTLE'` with the exact names used in your database if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal, you can structure your SQL query similarly to the previous ones, ensuring you select appropriate fields and include the condition for round trip fares. Here’s an example SQL query to find round trip flights for the specified route:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE 
     CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
     AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
     AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

This query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table for flights that go from Orlando to Montreal. It also matches airports to the respective cities and filters for round-trip fares by checking if `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is marked as "YES". Adjust the field names according to your actual database schema if they differ.

To show round trips between Montreal and Orlando, you can use the following SQL query. This query will retrieve flights that depart from Montreal to Orlando and then return from Orlando to Montreal, ensuring that both flights are linked as part of the same round trip:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT_DEP.FLIGHT_ID AS Departure_Flight_ID, FLIGHT_RET.FLIGHT_ID AS Return_Flight_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_montreal, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_orlando, 
     CITY AS CITY_montreal, 
     CITY AS CITY_orlando, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_DEP, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT_RET 
WHERE CITY_montreal.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_montreal.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_montreal.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
  AND CITY_orlando.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_orlando.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_orlando.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHT_DEP.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_montreal.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_DEP.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_orlando.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_RET.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_orlando.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT_RET.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_montreal.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used:**
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Montreal and Orlando to link cities to their respective airport codes.
  - `CITY` to ensure the query is looking for the correct city names.
  - `FLIGHT` twice, once for departure flights from Montreal to Orlando (FLIGHT_DEP) and once for return flights from Orlando to Montreal (FLIGHT_RET).

- **Conditions:**
  - The first set of conditions ensures we look for flights from Montreal (origin) to Orlando (destination).
  - The second set of conditions pairs that with flights returning from Orlando back to Montreal, effectively creating round trip links.

This SQL will yield the flight IDs of valid round trips between the two cities. Adjust the time and date conditions accordingly if you need specific departure/return times or dates.

### Explanation:
- The query selects the distinct `FLIGHT_ID` for flights that meet the criteria of traveling from "MONTREAL" to "ORLANDO".
- It joins relevant tables such as `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` to find appropriate routes.
- It specifically checks that round trip is required by including the condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"`. This ensures that only those fares marked as round trip are included in the results.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

      AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

This query selects distinct pairs of departure and return flight IDs for round trips from BURBANK to TACOMA. It joins the necessary tables to ensure the flights are correctly routed and filtered by the specified origin and destination cities.

Raw LLM Response:
Here is the SQL query to book a round trip flight from KANSAS CITY to CHICAGO, taking into account the necessary joins between the relevant tables to ensure proper connections between cities, airports, and flight fares:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,

  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs.
- It joins various tables, considering both the city names (KANSAS CITY and CHICAGO) and their associated airport codes.
- It also checks that the fare allows for round trips by specifying `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'`. 

You would need to adjust the date and any other restrictions or preferences (such as specific departure times) to fit your booking needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To find economy flights from Kansas City (KANSAS CITY) to Las Vegas (LAS VEGAS), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
    SELECT FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID
    FROM FLIGHT_FARE,
         FARE
    WHERE FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
      AND FARE.BOOKING_CLASS = "ECONOMY"
  );
```

**Explanation:**

- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE**: This is used to get the airport codes for Kansas City and Las Vegas by joining with the corresponding city names.
- **JOIN**: It connects the airport services for Kansas City and Las Vegas to the appropriate flight records.
- **BOOKING_CLASS**: The subquery ensures that only flights that have an associated economy fare are considered.
- **DISTINCT**: This ensures that duplicate flight IDs are not returned. 

Make sure to replace `"KANSAS CITY"` and `"LAS VEGAS"` with appropriate city names as they are stored in your `CITY` table, and adjust the SQL syntax according to your database system if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To fetch economy flights from Kansas City to Las Vegas based on the provided database schema, you would need to join the appropriate tables for the cities, airport services, flights, and fare basis related to economy class. Here's a possible SQL query for your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_ID IN (SELECT FARE_ID
                              FROM FARE_BASIS
                              WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = 'ECONOMY')
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FAFlight_FARE.FLIGHT_ID;
```

In this query:
1. We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both Kansas City and Las Vegas to find the correct airport codes.
2. We join the `FLIGHT` table to get available flights.
3. We filter for economy class fares using the `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables to check against the fare class defined as 'ECONOMY'.
4. We use the appropriate relationships between the tables to connect the flight and fare details correctly.

Make sure to adapt or refine the subqueries or joins depending on the exact requirements and the relationships defined in your actual database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find economy flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the relevant tables to retrieve the flight information based on the city names and filter by the economy class of service.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
           SELECT FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID 
           FROM FLIGHT_FARE 
           JOIN FARE ON FARE.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID
           WHERE FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN (
               SELECT FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS 
               FROM FARE_BASIS 
               WHERE FARE_BASIS.CLASS_TYPE = 'ECONOMY'
           )
       )
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Joined**: 
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: To find the airport codes corresponding to Las Vegas and Baltimore.
   - `CITY`: To match city names with their codes.
   - `FLIGHT`: To get flights from one airport to another.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: To link flights with their fare information.
   - `FARE`: To filter based on fare class.

2. **Filters**: 
   - The query checks for direct flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore.
   - It filters for the economy class fares.

You may need to replace the names of the actual fare classes or adjust the query based on any specific fare basis used in your database.

Make sure that the names and the class types align with your schema as the class type 'ECONOMY' in this example may vary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve economy class flights from LAS VEGAS to BALTIMORE, you can use the following SQL query. This query will involve joining the appropriate tables such as AIRPORT_SERVICE for the airports, CITY for the cities, FLIGHT for the flights, and FARE for pricing details based on economy class.

Here’s the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "ECONOMY" 
    AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **Table Joins**: The query joins several tables to connect the relevant data, ensuring city names match the correct airport service codes for both departure (LAS VEGAS) and arrival (BALTIMORE).
- **Fare Basis Condition**: It also checks that the fare basis corresponds to economy class (`"ECONOMY"`).
- **Distinct Flights**: The results ensure that only unique flight IDs are returned. 

You can replace `"ECONOMY"` with the actual booking class code if you have a specific code for economy in your `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table. Adjust the query accordingly based on the actual structure and naming conventions in your database schema if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve available economy flights from Baltimore to Kansas City, you will want to query the necessary tables for flight details, considering the economy fare. Below is the SQL query that fulfills this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO"
       AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN 
           (SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE 
            FROM FARE_BASIS 
            WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = 'Y' -- Assuming 'Y' is for economy
           )
);
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table, where the relevant connections and conditions are set.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the appropriate airport codes for Baltimore and Kansas City.
- It filters the results to find flights that have economy fares available through checking against relevant fare information.
- The `FARE_BASIS` table is filtered to include only those classes representing economy (typically identified by a specific booking class, often 'Y' for economy).

Please ensure to replace `'Y'` in the query with the correct code for the economy booking class from your `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` if it's different.

Question: ground transportation in LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about ground transportation options in Las Vegas (LAS), you can query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, joined with the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables to obtain relevant details.

Here’s a SQL query that could be used to show ground transportation services in Las Vegas:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE, 
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME, 
    CITY.CITY_NAME 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE 
    CITY.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS";
```

This query will provide the types of transportation available (from the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` column) along with their corresponding fares (`GROUND_FARE`), as well as the associated airport name and city name.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE, 
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME, 
    CITY.CITY_NAME

    GROUND_SERVICE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE

Question: what ground transportation is there in BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the ground transportation options in Baltimore, you can query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table and join it with the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables to get the relevant information. Here's a SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE";
```

In this SQL query:
- We select the distinct `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table on the `CITY_CODE`.
- We filter the results to only include records where the city name is "BALTIMORE." 

This will provide you with the types of ground transportation available in Baltimore along with their respective fares.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE";

Question: is there ground transportation available at the DENVER airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check for ground transportation available at the DENVER airport, you would need to query the GROUND_SERVICE table to see if there are any services linked to the airport code for Denver. Below is the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

In this query, we join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for records where the airport name is "DENVER". This will return the types of ground transportation available at the Denver airport.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the type of ground transportation available at the LAS VEGAS airport, you would join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `GROUND_SERVICE` table based on the airport code that corresponds to LAS VEGAS. Additionally, you would filter by the city and airport name. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS";
```

This query selects distinct transportation types available at the LAS VEGAS airport, utilizing the relationships between the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `GROUND_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To fetch the cheapest one-way flights from MONTREAL to ORLANDO, you would need to join the relevant tables and use sorting to find the lowest fare. Here's the SQL query you could use for that purpose:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Cheapest_Fare
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL")
                                    AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO")
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
                        AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO"
GROUP BY FAREalias0.FARE_ID
ORDER BY Cheapest_Fare ASC;
```

### Explanation:
- **Joins**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to identify the airport codes for the cities MONTREAL and ORLANDO.
- **Fare Table**: It then joins the `FARE` table to get the possible one-way fares based on the airport codes found.
- **Filtering**: It filters out fares that are not one-way by checking `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO"`.
- **Aggregation**: It groups by `FARE_ID` to get the minimum fare for the specified route.
- **Sorting**: Finally, it orders the results by the fare amount in ascending order so the cheapest fare will be at the top of the result set.

This will give you a list of fare IDs along with the cheapest fare for one-way flights from MONTREAL to ORLANDO. Remember to adjust according to your database specifics (field names, type of quotes, etc.).

### Explanation:
- **Joins**: 
    - We're joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to relate Orlando and Montreal with their respective airport codes.
    - The `FARE` table is joined to get the fares associated with flights between the two locations.
- **Filters**: 
    - We're ensuring that the flight is one-way by specifying `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO"`.
- **Sorting**: 
    - The results are ordered by `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` in ascending order to find the cheapest fare.
- **Limit**: 
    - Using `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the cheapest fare is returned. 

Make sure the SQL syntax aligns with the specific SQL dialect of the database you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), as slight variations may exist.

Question: show me nonstop flights from MONTREAL to ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find nonstop flights from Montreal to Orlando, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;
```

In this query:
- `FROM_AIRPORT` is matched to the airport service for Montreal and `TO_AIRPORT` is matched to the airport service for Orlando.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` ensures that only nonstop flights are selected.

Raw LLM Response:
To show nonstop flights from TORONTO to ST. PETERSBURG, you would need to filter the flights based on the source and destination airports, ensuring that the number of stops is zero. The SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Ensuring nonstop flights
```

In this query:
- You join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get the airport codes for both cities from their respective `CITY` entries.
- You filter for nonstop flights by adding the condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0`.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Toronto to St. Petersburg, you can use the following SQL query. This query will select flight IDs where the flight from the specified origin city to the destination city does not have any stops:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming that the FLIGHT table has a column 'STOPS'
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: The query joins several tables to link city codes to airport codes and flight data.
2. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights that are specifically from Toronto to St. Petersburg.
   - Ensures that the flight does not have any stops (assuming there is a column `STOPS` in the `FLIGHT` table that indicates the number of stops). If the `STOPS` column does not exist, you may need an alternate method to check for nonstop flights.

Question: give me the flights from MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS nonstop
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS that are nonstop, you need to look for flights where the number of stops is zero. Based on the database schema provided, you can query the `FLIGHT` table to filter records for flights that meet these criteria. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming 0 means nonstop flights
```

In this query:
1. We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the corresponding airport codes for MEMPHIS and LAS VEGAS.
2. We then join with the `FLIGHT` table to find compatible flights between these two locations.
3. The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` filters for nonstop flights. 

Make sure to adjust the query based on the actual representation of stops in your `FLIGHT` table if it differs.

Question: what are the nonstop flights between HOUSTON and MEMPHIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights between Houston and Memphis, we need to check the `FLIGHT` table for flights that directly connect the two cities without any stops. This can be achieved by ensuring that the stops count is zero in the `FLIGHT` table. Here's an SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;
```

In this query, we are:
1. Joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to identify the appropriate airport codes for Houston and Memphis.
2. Accessing the `FLIGHT` table to pull out the flight details.
3. Specifying that we only want flights with `STOPS = 0` to ensure they are nonstop flights.

      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO";
```

This query includes:
- Selecting the distinct flight IDs.
- Joining the necessary tables to link the cities, the airports, and the flights.
- Filtering for the specific departure city (COLUMBUS) and arrival city (CHICAGO).
- Adding a condition to filter flights that depart before 10:00 AM and that are one-way, indicated by `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO"`. 

Make sure to adjust the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` condition based on your schema if it's not needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Indianapolis to Memphis that depart before 10:00 AM on any day, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IS NOT NULL;  -- This condition ensures the flight is scheduled on at least one day
```

This query performs the following steps:
1. Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables based on the city names of Indianapolis and Memphis.
2. Filters for flights that are departing before 10:00 AM (`DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'`).
3. Ensures that the flight has a scheduled day by checking that `FLIGHT_DAYS` is not null.
4. Selects distinct flight IDs for the requested flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain flights from CLEVELAND to DALLAS that leave before 12:00 PM, you can frame your SQL query similarly to the previous examples while ensuring that you filter the departure times correctly. Here’s the SQL query you might use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Selected**: The query selects from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables, similar to previous examples.
2. **City Filter**: It filters for CLEVELAND and DALLAS as the source and destination cities, respectively.
3. **Departure Time Condition**: The `DEPARTURE_TIME` is filtered to be less than 12:00 PM (12:00:00).
4. **Distinct**: `DISTINCT` is included to ensure that each flight ID is unique in the results.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 9:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves distinct flight IDs of flights that depart from Cincinnati to Tampa.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables based on the condition that each city matches the respective airport service.
- Additionally, it filters the results to include only those flights where the departure time is earlier than 9:00 AM.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from HOUSTON to DALLAS before midnight (0:00), you would need to filter the results based on the departure time. Here is an SQL statement that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '00:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause is used to return unique flight IDs.
- `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables are joined to filter the results based on the departure city (HOUSTON) and arrival city (DALLAS).
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '00:00:00'` filters the flights that leave before midnight.

Raw LLM Response:
To query a list of flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS that leave before 12:00 PM (1200 hours), you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '1200';
```

Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to identify the appropriate airport codes for INDIANAPOLIS and MEMPHIS.
- It filters the results to include only flights departing before 12:00 PM by using the condition `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '1200'`.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the type of aircraft flying from Cleveland to Dallas before 12:00 PM, you would need to join the relevant tables to filter the flights from Cleveland to Dallas and retrieve the associated aircraft details. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, AIRCRAFT.MANUFACTURER, AIRCRAFT.BASIC_TYPE
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: This is used to ensure that the result set contains unique aircraft types.
- **Tables Joined**:
  - **FLIGHT**: Used to access flight details including departure times.
  - **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: Joined twice to link the source (Cleveland) and destination (Dallas) airports.
  - **CITY**: Joined twice to filter for cities by their names.
  - **EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE**: This links the flight to the corresponding aircraft code.
  - **AIRCRAFT**: This contains the details about the types of aircraft.
- **WHERE Clauses**: 
  - Filters for the specific cities (Cleveland and Dallas) and the condition that the departure time is before 12:00 PM. 

This way, you will get a list of aircraft types that are operating flights from Cleveland to Dallas before noon.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve morning flights on American Airlines (AA) from Philadelphia to Dallas, the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '05:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

This query:
- Selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- Joins relevant tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY`) to filter for flights originating in Philadelphia and destined for Dallas.
- Filters for flights operated by American Airlines (`"AA"`).
- Limits results to those departing in the morning, defined here as between 5 AM and 12 PM. Adjust the time range as needed to suit your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight from Boston to Washington DC, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the flight ID and the arrival time of flights from Boston to Washington, then sorts the results to get the earliest arrival:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON DC" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:

1. The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to filter the flights from Boston to Washington DC.
2. It selects the `FLIGHT_ID` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` from the `FLIGHT` table.
3. It sorts the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME` in ascending order to find the earliest arriving flight.
4. The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the earliest flight is returned.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight between BOSTON and WASHINGTON DC, you would need to join the relevant tables and get the minimum arrival time. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON DC" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME ASC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Tables**: We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to gather information about flights from BOSTON (CITY_NAME) to WASHINGTON DC.
2. **Filtering Conditions**: We filter the cities to ensure we're only looking at those specific routes.
3. **Ordering**: We order the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME` in ascending order to get the earliest flight.
4. **Limit**: We use `LIMIT 1` to return only the earliest flight. 

This query will provide the `FLIGHT_ID` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` of the earliest flight between BOSTON and WASHINGTON DC.

```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the airport codes for Houston and Orlando.
2. **WHERE Clause**: The conditions ensure that we only consider flights originating from Houston and arriving in Orlando.
3. **ORDER BY**: This sorts the flights by their `ARRIVAL_TIME` in ascending order.
4. **LIMIT 1**: Ensures that only the earliest flight is returned. 

This query will provide the flight ID of the earliest flight from Houston to Orlando along with its arrival time. If you need additional details like the flight number or the airline, you could modify the SELECT clause to include those fields.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight from Houston to Orlando, you need to select the flight details and order them by the arrival time. Here's how the SQL query can be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs and arrival times from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the necessary tables for `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` to filter for flights departing from Houston and arriving in Orlando.
- The results are ordered by `ARRIVAL_TIME` to find the earliest arriving flight.
- `LIMIT 1` is used to return only the earliest flight.

Question: what is TPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "TPA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To answer your question about "TPA," it seems you are looking for the definition or description of the acronym or code "TPA" based on the provided database schema. However, the schema does not provide a direct reference for what "TPA" represents.

To find out what "TPA" might correspond to, you can check if it exists in the context of airports or any relevant codes. Commonly, "TPA" refers to Tampa International Airport in Florida.

If you want to retrieve information from the database schema regarding TPA, you can utilize the `AIRPORT` or `CODE_DESCRIPTION` tables since they may contain airport codes or related descriptions.

Here's a SQL query example that would check the `AIRPORT` table for an airport with the code "TPA":

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION, STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'TPA';
```

This query fetches the airport name, location, state code, and country name for the airport code "TPA" if it exists in the `AIRPORT` table.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION, STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'TPA';

Question: i need a DAILY flight from ST. LOUIS to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a daily flight from St. Louis to Milwaukee, the SQL query would involve fetching flights from the relevant airport services, ensuring they operate daily. Here's how you can write the SQL statement for this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = 'DAILY';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get the correct airports corresponding to St. Louis and Milwaukee.
- The `CITY` table is used to ensure we filter the cities correctly.
- The condition `AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = 'DAILY'` ensures that only flights operating daily are fetched. 

Please adjust any field names if they differ in your actual schema (like in case 'DAILY' is stored with different capitalization or description).

Question: what does fare code BH mean
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE FROM FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 WHERE FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "BH" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the description for the fare code "BH", you would typically query the `FARE_BASIS` table based on the `FARE_BASIS_CODE`, as this schema indicates that there is a relationship for fare codes to descriptions. 

Here is your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS, FARE_BASIS.CLASS_TYPE, FARE_BASIS.PREMIUM, FARE_BASIS.ECONOMY, FARE_BASIS.DISCOUNTED, FARE_BASIS.NIGHT, FARE_BASIS.SEASON, FARE_BASIS.BASIS_DAYS 
FROM FARE_BASIS 
WHERE FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'BH';
```

This query retrieves all relevant information associated with the fare code "BH" from the `FARE_BASIS` table, including its booking class, class type, premium, economy, discounted, night, season, and basis days. Adjust this query as necessary depending on the exact details you want to retrieve.

Raw LLM Response:
To find out what the fare code "BH" means, you would typically query the `FARE_BASIS` table that contains fare basis codes and their descriptions. Based on the schema provided, we can formulate an SQL query to select the relevant information.

Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE, BOOKING_CLASS, CLASS_TYPE, PREMIUM, ECONOMY, DISCOUNTED, NIGHT, SEASON, BASIS_DAYS 
FROM FARE_BASIS 
WHERE FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'BH';
```

This query retrieves all the details associated with the fare code "BH" from the `FARE_BASIS` table, which should include its booking class, class type, pricing categories, and any limitations such as whether it's a premium, economy, or discounted fare.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Dallas to Houston that depart after 12:01 AM, you'll want to query the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to get the relevant airport codes for Dallas and Houston. The `DEPARTURE_TIME` of the flights should also be checked to ensure it is after 12:01 AM.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '00:01:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM**: We're utilizing `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to link cities to their respective airport codes.
- **WHERE clauses**:
    - We check the city names (DALLAS and HOUSTON).
    - We compare the `DEPARTURE_TIME` of the flights to ensure they are later than 12:01 AM (in a 24-hour format this is `00:01:00`). 
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: We ensure that we only get unique flight IDs in the result. 

Adjust the date or any other parameters if needed based on your specific requirements.

Question: what cities does NW fly out of
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cities that Northwest Airlines (NW) flies out of, you would need to look at the `AIRLINE` and `FLIGHT` tables to filter for flights associated with Northwest Airlines and then correlate those flights to the corresponding airports and cities. Here’s a possible SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias.CITY_NAME
FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias ON AIRLINEalias.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTalias.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias ON FLIGHTalias.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.CITY_CODE = CITYalias.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRLINEalias.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

In this query:
- We start by selecting distinct city names.
- We join the `AIRLINE` table with the `FLIGHT` table to find flights operated by Northwest Airlines (using 'NW' as the airline code).
- We then join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get the airport codes associated with those flights.
- Finally, we join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` with the `CITY` table to fetch the city names corresponding to the airports from which NW operates flights.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias.CITY_NAME
FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias ON AIRLINEalias.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTalias.AIRLINE_CODE

JOIN CITY AS CITYalias ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.CITY_CODE = CITYalias.CITY_CODE

Question: list the cities from which NW flies
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the cities from which the airline "NW" (presumably Northwest Airlines) flies, you would need to query the `FLIGHT` table to filter flights by the `AIRLINE_CODE` corresponding to "NW". You would then join with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to obtain the corresponding city names.

Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias ON FLIGHTalias.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.CITY_CODE = CITYalias.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

This query does the following:
- Selects unique city names (`CITY_NAME`) from the `CITY` table.
- Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the corresponding airports.
- Joins with the `CITY` table to get city names based on those airports.
- Filters the results based on the `AIRLINE_CODE` to only include flights operated by "NW".
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias ON FLIGHTalias.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.CITY_CODE = CITYalias.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the list of cities that Northwest Airlines (NW) flies to, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the appropriate tables to find all destination cities associated with flights operated by Northwest Airlines.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias1.CITY_NAME 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW";
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
1. **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0:** We're selecting from the `FLIGHT` table to get the flights associated with Northwest Airlines.
2. **JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1:** We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to identify the end airports of the flights.
3. **JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1:** We join the `CITY` table to get the names of the cities corresponding to those airports.
4. **WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW":** We filter the results to only include flights operated by Northwest Airlines.

This query will give you a distinct list of city names where Northwest Airlines operates flights.

Question: what the abbreviation US stand for
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out what the abbreviation "US" stands for within the context of your database schema, you can use the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table which likely contains codes and their descriptions.

Here’s the SQL query to retrieve the description for the code "US":

```sql
SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = "US";
```

This query selects the DESCRIPTION field from the CODE_DESCRIPTION table where the CODE matches 'US'. This should give you the meaning associated with that abbreviation, if it exists in the database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = "US";

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the details of the airline with the code "US", you can use a simple SQL query to select the relevant information from the AIRLINE table. Here's how you can write that query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'US';
```

This query will return all columns for the airline that has an airline code of "US". If you are only interested in the airline name or details, you can specify the columns you wish to retrieve, like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_NAME, NOTE FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'US';
``` 

This will give you the name and any notes associated with the airline "US".

Question: what airline is AS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find information about the airline with the code "AS", you would typically query the `AIRLINE` table in the database. The SQL query you would use is as follows:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_NAME, NOTE FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```

This query selects the airline name and any notes associated with that airline from the `AIRLINE` table where the airline code matches "AS". If you want to retrieve all available information for that airline, you can simply select all columns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT AIRLINE_NAME, NOTE FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';

Question: what airline is a s AS in sam
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the airline with the code starting with "AS" or to include a specific airline description containing "AS" (as in "AS in Sam"), you would typically use a `SELECT` statement that queries the `AIRLINE` table based on the airline code or name. Here's an example of how the SQL query might look for finding airline codes that start with "AS":

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM AIRLINE 
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE LIKE 'AS%' OR AIRLINE_NAME LIKE '%AS%';
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause retrieves unique airline codes and names.
- From the `AIRLINE` table, we filter results using `WHERE`.
- The `LIKE 'AS%'` condition checks for airline codes starting with "AS".
- Additionally, `LIKE '%AS%'` checks for any airline names that contain "AS".

This SQL will return all airlines that have a code starting with "AS" or have "AS" in their airline name.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM AIRLINE 
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE LIKE 'AS%' OR AIRLINE_NAME LIKE '%AS%';

Question: what airline is HP
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "HP" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about the airline with the airline code "HP", you can query the `AIRLINE` table, which contains the details of the airlines. Here’s the SQL statement you would use:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM AIRLINE 
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'HP';
```

This query will return the name of the airline associated with the code "HP". If you need more information from the airline table, you can select additional columns as needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the flights from CLEVELAND to MIAMI on Wednesday, arriving before 16:00, your SQL statement can be constructed as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < "16:00";
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both CLEVELAND and MIAMI to find the respective airport codes.
- It also joins `CITY` to confirm the city names match.
- The `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables help ensure the flights are scheduled for Wednesday.
- Finally, it restricts the results to flights arriving before 16:00.

Question: list airports in LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports in Los Angeles, you can join the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to filter the entries based on the city name. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT 
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT.STATE_CODE = CITY.STATE_CODE AND AIRPORT.COUNTRY_NAME = CITY.COUNTRY_NAME 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

This query retrieves distinct airport codes and names from the `AIRPORT` table where the associated city is Los Angeles, assuming the appropriate relationships between the airport and city tables.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT 
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT.STATE_CODE = CITY.STATE_CODE AND AIRPORT.COUNTRY_NAME = CITY.COUNTRY_NAME 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';

Question: tell me all the airports near WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the airports near Westchester County, you can join the `AIRPORT` table with the `CITY` table and the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table, filtering by the appropriate `CITY_NAME`. Here's an SQL query that should achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_LOCATION, AIRPORTalias0.STATE_CODE, AIRPORTalias0.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WHITE PLAINS" AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE = "NY" -- Assuming White Plains is indicative of Westchester County
```

### Explanation:

1. **Table Selection**: The query selects fields from the `AIRPORT` table (airport code, name, location, state, and country) and joins it with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
2. **Join Condition**: The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined based on the airport code, and `CITY` is joined on the city code to get the necessary city information.
3. **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include airports related to "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" (with the assumption here that "WHITE PLAINS" is the principal city in that county). Adjust the city name as needed if there are other representative cities or to fetch more cities in the county if available.

Please update the `CITY_NAME` if you have a specific city in mind or need to expand the scope to include other cities in the Westchester County area.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the airports in the New York area, we can utilize the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to identify the relevant airports associated with New York. Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_LOCATION, AIRPORT.alias0.STATE_CODE, AIRPORT.alias0.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

This query joins the `AIRPORT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables to select the distinct airports in New York. It will return the airport codes, names, locations, state codes, and country names for airports located in New York. Adjust the `CITY_NAME` condition if you are looking for specific areas or neighborhoods within New York City.

Question: i need to RENTAL CAR at TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find information about renting a car at Tampa, you would likely want to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, assuming this table includes the rental car services available at different airports.

Here's a possible SQL query to get the rental car services available at Tampa:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR";
```

This query selects distinct rental car types and their associated fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table for the city of Tampa. Adjust the field names and conditions based on your actual schema and data requirements if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight that leaves on Sunday from Montreal, Quebec to San Diego, California, you would structure your SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Tables**: We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both cities (Montreal and San Diego) and use `CITY` to filter by city names.
2. **Flight Selection**: We join the `FLIGHT` table to find flights that start from the airport in Montreal and go to San Diego.
3. **Day Condition**: The `DAYS` table is used to filter the flights specifically for those that occur on Sunday. We ensure that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` matches the `DAYS_CODE` for Sunday.

Make sure to replace the names of cities in the `CITY_NAME` clause if the exact names in the database differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from PHOENIX, ARIZONA to ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA on Tuesday, you would need to follow a similar structure as your previous SQL queries, incorporating the relevant tables, filtering for the correct cities and ensuring you only consider flights on Tuesday. Below is the SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "TUESDAY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT** - This ensures that you only get unique flight IDs.
2. **FROM** - Here, multiple tables are joined: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for the origin and destination airports, `CITY` to get the city codes, and `FLIGHT` to get the actual flights.
3. **WHERE** - Various conditions are applied:
   - The city names are matched to filter for PHOENIX and ST. PAUL.
   - The airports associated with these cities are connected to the `FLIGHT` table.
   - The departure day is specifically set for Tuesday by matching the `DAY_NAME`.
  
Make sure to adjust any additional filters or conditions as needed based on your specific requirements or data schema.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "F" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the description or details of the fare code "F," you would typically need to access the `FARE_BASIS` or `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table in the database schema since these tables contain information about fare codes and their associated descriptions. 

Here's an SQL query to obtain the fare code meaning from the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table:

```sql
SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = 'F';
```

If `FARE_BASIS` contains relevant information, you can use the following query instead:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM FARE_BASIS 
WHERE FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'F';
```

Choose either query based on where the description for the fare code "F" is stored in your database schema.

SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = 'F';

Question: what does fare code H mean
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "H" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To understand what fare code H means, you would typically need to join the `FARE_BASIS` table to get the relevant details. Given the provided schema, a SQL query to retrieve the description and details associated with fare code H would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS, 
    FARE_BASIS.CLASS_TYPE, 
    FARE_BASIS.PREMIUM, 
    FARE_BASIS.ECONOMY, 
    FARE_BASIS.DISCOUNTED, 
    FARE_BASIS.NIGHT, 
    FARE_BASIS.SEASON, 
    FARE_BASIS.BASIS_DAYS,
    CODE_DESCRIPTION.DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FARE_BASIS
JOIN 
    CODE_DESCRIPTION ON FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = CODE_DESCRIPTION.CODE
WHERE 
    FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'H';
```
This query retrieves details such as the booking class type, whether it's premium or discounted, and any specific description associated with fare code H. It assumes that the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table contains complementary information about fare codes.

Question: what class is fare code Q
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "Q" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the class associated with the fare code "Q," you would typically need to join the `FARE_BASIS` table with the `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table in your database schema. The `FARE_BASIS` table contains the fare basis code and its associated booking class, while the `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table provides descriptions and ranks for each class. 

Here's how you can write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICE.RANK, CLASS_OF_SERVICE.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM FARE_BASIS
JOIN CLASS_OF_SERVICE ON FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS = CLASS_OF_SERVICE.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'Q';
```

This query performs the following actions:
- It selects the distinct `RANK` and `CLASS_DESCRIPTION` from the `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table.
- It joins the `FARE_BASIS` table with `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` based on the `BOOKING_CLASS`.
- It filters results where the `FARE_BASIS_CODE` is "Q". 

This will give you the relevant class information for fare code "Q".
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICE.RANK, CLASS_OF_SERVICE.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM FARE_BASIS
JOIN CLASS_OF_SERVICE ON FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS = CLASS_OF_SERVICE.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'Q';

Question: list the airlines with flights to or from DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airlines with flights to or from Denver, you can use the following SQL query. This query will check for all flights either departing from or arriving at airports that serve the city of Denver:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' OR CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct airline codes and names from the `AIRLINE` table.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table to get the flights associated with each airline, and further joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter based on the city name.
- The `WHERE` clause checks if either the departure city (from airport) or the arrival city (to airport) is Denver. This way, it includes airlines that have flights going to or from Denver.

Question: how many NW flights leave ST. PAUL
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query the number of flights from St. Paul operated by Northwest Airlines (referred to as NW), you can use an SQL statement that counts the distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table, while checking the departure airport for St. Paul and the airline code for Northwest Airlines.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS NW_Flight_Count
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL"
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW";
```

In this query:
- We count the distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the necessary tables to filter the results for flights that have `FROM_AIRPORT` matching the airport code for St. Paul and are operated by Northwest Airlines (identified by the airline code "NW").
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS NW_Flight_Count
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL"
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW";

Raw LLM Response:
To list airfares for FIRST class round trip from DETROIT to ST. PETERSBURG, you can construct an SQL query similar to this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,

  AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST"
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joining Tables**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables to filter results based on the cities of DETROIT and ST. PETERSBURG.
2. **Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause ensures that the endpoints are specified and that only fares labeled as FIRST class and that require a round trip are returned.
3. **Selected Fields**: The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause is used to return unique fares along with costs for both one-way and round trips. 

This query provides a structured way to retrieve the specific flight fare information needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To list COACH round trip airfare from DETROIT to ST. PETERSBURG, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves fare information for round trips specifically for the COACH class of service:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" 
       AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES")
  AND FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
  AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "COACH";
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct fare IDs, one-direction costs, and round-trip costs from the `FARE` table.
- It utilizes the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to match the city names "DETROIT" and "ST. PETERSBURG" with their corresponding airport codes.
- The `FARE` table is filtered to include only round trips (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"`).
- It also joins with the `FARE_BASIS` table to find fares that belong to the "COACH" booking class.
- This ensures that only relevant coach round trip fares between the two specified cities are listed.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the cost of a FIRST class ticket from DETROIT to LAS VEGAS and back, you will want to join the necessary tables to find the appropriate fare for a ROUND trip in FIRST class. Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, 
    FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
    CITY AS CITYalias0, 
    CITY AS CITYalias1, 
    FARE AS FAREalias0, 
    FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
    AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES" 
    AND FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
    AND FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Data**: The query selects `FARE_ID` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table.
2. **Joining Tables**: It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` to relate the fare information to the respective airports and cities.
3. **City Filtering**: It checks for flights from "DETROIT" to "LAS VEGAS".
4. **Round Trip Requirement**: Ensures that the fare is for a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"`).
5. **Class Requirement**: Filters for the FIRST class tickets by ensuring the booking class matches "FIRST".

This query provides the relevant fare information for a round trip FIRST class ticket from DETROIT to LAS VEGAS.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares on flights from WASHINGTON to TORONTO specifically on a Saturday, you would need to join the relevant tables including AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, FLIGHT, and FARE. The SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY";
```

This query does the following:
1. Joins the necessary tables to correlate airports, cities, and flights.
2. Filters on the specific departure city (WASHINGTON) and destination city (TORONTO).
3. Ensures that the flights are scheduled on a Saturday.
4. Selects distinct fare IDs along with one-way and round-trip costs, which will give you the fares associated with the flights meeting your criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve Saturday fares from Washington to Boston, you would want to follow a similar structure as your previous queries, making sure to include the logic for filtering by the specific day of the week. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY';
```

In this query:
- We join the appropriate tables to link cities, airports, and fares.
- We set the departure city to Washington and the arrival city to Boston.
- We filter to only include fares valid for Saturday by checking against the `DAYS` table where the `DAY_NAME` is 'SATURDAY'. 

Make sure this query aligns with the structure of your database and that the fields used are correctly referenced as per your schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve SATURDAY fares from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL, you can use the following SQL query. This query will pull fare information based on the specified cities, and we will filter for fares applicable to Saturdays.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0,
     RESTRICTION AS RESTRICTIONalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL"
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND RESTRICTIONalias0.RESTRICTION_CODE = FAREalias0.RESTRICTION_CODE
  AND RESTRICTIONalias0.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

In this query:

- We join the necessary tables to access the fare information and apply the filters for the specified cities.
- We filter the results to ensure that we're getting fares that require a Saturday stay (assuming the relevant field for restrictions is `SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED`).

Make sure to adjust any field names based on your actual database schema if they differ from the provided schema structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain the Saturday fares from WASHINGTON to TORONTO, you would need to query the relevant tables to find the airports corresponding to these cities, and then filter the flights that are available on Saturdays. Below is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query begins by selecting distinct fare IDs from the `FARE` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `DAYS`, and `FARE` tables to correlate the flights and fares based on the specified departure and arrival cities.
- It checks that the departure city is WASHINGTON and the destination is TORONTO.
- Additionally, it filters for only those rows where the day of the flight is a Saturday using the `DAYS` table, ensuring that it aligns with the days available in the `FLIGHT` table.
  
Feel free to modify the query according to any specific requirements or additional filters you might have.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the SATURDAY fare from WASHINGTON to TORONTO, you need to select from the appropriate tables, ensuring that you account for the fare basis code associated with the SATURDAY travel. The SQL query should look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" 
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
      AND FARE_BASISalias0.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Distinct Fares**: The query selects distinct fare IDs and their costs.
2. **Join Tables**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables to filter results based on the specified cities and their corresponding airports.
3. **Filter Criteria**:
   - The departure city is "WASHINGTON" and the destination city is "TORONTO".
   - The fare basis code is checked for any restriction that requires a Saturday stay.

This query retrieves fares specifically associated with Saturday trips from WASHINGTON to TORONTO.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first flight from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on a Thursday, you would want to specify both the departure airport and the arrival airport from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table, as well as ensure that the flight is scheduled for a Thursday. The SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "THURSDAY" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **FROM**: This part sets up joins through the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the respective airport codes for OAKLAND and SALT LAKE CITY.
- **WHERE**: The conditions in this clause filter for flights that depart from OAKLAND and arrive in SALT LAKE CITY on a Thursday.
- **ORDER BY**: This orders the results by the departure time.
- **LIMIT 1**: This ensures that only the first available flight is returned after sorting.

This query assumes you have a proper understanding of the structure of your database and that the tables and relationships are correctly set up as per the schema you provided.

Question: list the AS flights from BURBANK to anywhere
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from BURBANK (CITY_CODE) to anywhere that have an airline code of "AS" (Alaska Airlines), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0

      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS";
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table that originate from the airport corresponding to the city of BURBANK, ensuring that the airline code matches "AS".

Question: list the AS flights from BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from BURBANK, using the schema provided, we would first need to identify the corresponding city code and airport code for BURBANK. Assuming that "BURBANK" refers to a city in the dataset, the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0**: This table links the cities to the relevant airports.
- **FROM CITY AS CITYalias0**: This table contains the names and codes for different cities.
- **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0**: This table contains information regarding flights.

### Conditions:
- **CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE**: This condition links the city to its corresponding airport in the airport service table.
- **CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK"**: This filters the cities to only include 'BURBANK'.
- **FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE**: This condition ensures that the flights considered are those that depart from the airport serving BURBANK.

By executing the above SQL query, you will receive a list of all flights departing from BURBANK.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights with the airline code "AS" (Alaska Airlines) that are departing from Burbank, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS";
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table, joining it with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` to filter for flights that are departing from Burbank and have the airline code "AS".
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight on American Airlines (AA) from Miami to Chicago that arrives around 5 PM, you will need to filter the flights based on the departure airport (Miami), the arrival airport (Chicago), the airline (AA), and the arrival time being close to 5 PM.

Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM and JOINs**: We are selecting from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to associate the cities with their respective airports.
- **City Filtering**: The query filters for flights departing from Miami and arriving in Chicago.
- **Airline Filtering**: The query specifies that we want flights operated by American Airlines (`AIRLINE_CODE = "AA"`).
- **Arrival Time Filtering**: It looks for flights that arrive between 5:00 PM (`'17:00:00'`) and 5:59 PM (`'17:59:59'`) to capture any flights arriving around that time. 

Ensure that the times specified match the format used in your database's `ARRIVAL_TIME` field, typically in `'HH:MM:SS'` format.

Question: show me the airports serviced by FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the airports serviced by the airline with the code 'FF', you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to get a list of airports associated with the specified airline.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION, AIRPORT.STATE_CODE, AIRPORT.COUNTRY_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
JOIN AIRLINE ON AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT ON AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = 'FF';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting distinct airport names and their details.
- We're joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `AIRLINE` tables to filter the results based on the airline code 'FF'.
- It gives you a clear list of all airports serviced by that particular airline.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest fare from INDIANAPOLIS to ORLANDO on the 27th of December, you will need to select the minimum fare where the origin and destination are the respective airports for the cities mentioned. Assuming the relevant tables in the schema are combined correctly, the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Cheapest_Fare 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 27 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = YEAR(CURDATE());  -- Use the current year, or replace with a specific year if needed
```

This SQL statement assumes:
- The fare from INDIANAPOLIS to ORLANDO is required for a specific day.
- The `DATE_DAY` table is used to filter by the specific date requested (27th of December).
- The `MIN` function is utilized to retrieve the cheapest fare.

Adjust the year as needed based on your requirements or context (for instance, you could change `YEAR(CURDATE())` to a specific year if required).

Raw LLM Response:
To answer the question "what is a D9S," we need to refer to the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table in the database schema. This table is likely designed to provide descriptions for various codes, which may include aircraft types, services, or other relevant codes.

Here’s the SQL query that could be used to retrieve the description for the code "D9S":

```sql
SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = 'D9S';
```

This query selects the `DESCRIPTION` from the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table where the `CODE` is equal to 'D9S'. The result will give you the meaning or details related to the code D9S.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the description of "D9S," you can query the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table, which is presumably used for storing different codes and their corresponding descriptions. Here's a possible SQL query to retrieve the description of "D9S":

```sql
SELECT DESCRIPTION 
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION 
WHERE CODE = 'D9S';
```

This query selects the `DESCRIPTION` from the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table where the `CODE` is 'D9S'. If the code exists in the table, you should get the description associated with it. If there is no entry for 'D9S', it will return an empty result set.

Question: what is the seating capacity of an M80
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "M80" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the seating capacity of an aircraft with the basic type "M80" (assuming M80 refers to a specific aircraft model), you would need to query the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `BASIC_TYPE` is "M80". Here is the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT AIRCRAFT_CODE, AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
WHERE BASIC_TYPE = 'M80';
```

This query selects the `AIRCRAFT_CODE`, `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION`, and `CAPACITY` of any aircraft that has "M80" as its basic type, which should provide you with the information regarding its seating capacity.

Question: what is 73S
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "73S" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the meaning of "73S" within the context of the provided database schema, we need to determine which table holds relevant information. Given that "73S" looks like a flight or aircraft designation, it could potentially reference either:

1. A specific flight number in the `FLIGHT` table.
2. An aircraft code in the `AIRCRAFT` table.

It's common for airline flight designations to include the airline's code followed by a flight number, so "73S" could refer to a flight number, in which case you'd look in the `FLIGHT` table. 

To get details related to "73S", you could run a SQL query to find any flights associated with it:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.* 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '73S';
```

If "73S" is an aircraft code instead, you would query the `AIRCRAFT` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.* 
FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 
WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = '73S';
```

You should run either of these queries depending on whether "73S" is intended as a flight number or an aircraft code. If there's specific context or additional information about "73S" you have, please provide further details for more precise assistance.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.* 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '73S';

Question: what is the seating capacity of a 757
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the seating capacity of a Boeing 757 from the provided database schema, you would generally query the `AIRCRAFT` table for the corresponding aircraft code or description. Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%757%';
```

This query checks for aircraft descriptions that contain "757" (which, depending on your definition, may cover different versions of the Boeing 757) and retrieves the `CAPACITY` for that aircraft type. If you know the specific `AIRCRAFT_CODE` for the 757 you are interested in, you can also filter by that directly.

Question: how many people will a 757 hold
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many people a Boeing 757 can hold, you would typically need to query the `AIRCRAFT` table to get the `CAPACITY` value for the aircraft with a specific `AIRCRAFT_CODE` associated with the Boeing 757.

Assuming the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` for a Boeing 757 is known (for example, it might be something like "757"), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_CODE = '757';
```

This query retrieves the `CAPACITY` of the Boeing 757 from the `AIRCRAFT` table, which represents the number of passengers it can hold. If you don't know the exact `AIRCRAFT_CODE`, you might first want to search for the Boeing 757 description in the `AIRCRAFT` table, like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRCRAFT_CODE, CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%757%';
```

This would allow you to find the aircraft code and capacity for any variants or specific configurations of the Boeing 757.

Question: how many passengers can fly on a 757
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out how many passengers can fly on a Boeing 757, you would need to look up the relevant information from the `AIRCRAFT` table. Specifically, you'd query the `CAPACITY` field for the aircraft that has a basic type or manufacturer indicating it is a Boeing 757.

Here is an example SQL query to fetch the capacity of a Boeing 757:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%757%';
```

This query assumes that the `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION` contains the term "757." Adjust the `LIKE` clause as needed based on how the aircraft is described in the database. If the aircraft is identified by another code or specific description, you might adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly.

Question: what is the seating capacity of the 757
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the seating capacity of the Boeing 757 from the database, you would typically look up the relevant aircraft data in the `AIRCRAFT` table. Specifically, you are interested in the `CAPACITY` column for the aircraft with the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` that corresponds to the 757.

Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%757%' OR AIRCRAFT_CODE = '757';
```

Note:
- This query uses a `LIKE` statement to match any aircraft description that contains "757". 
- If there's a specific `AIRCRAFT_CODE` for the 757 (like "757"), you can check that as well.
- Make sure the actual `AIRCRAFT_CODE` or `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION` accurately corresponds to your database's naming conventions.

Question: tell me about the M80 aircraft
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "M80" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about the M80 aircraft from the `AIRCRAFT` table using the provided database schema, you would use a SQL query that filters based on the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` for the M80 model. Here’s how you could formulate the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM AIRCRAFT
WHERE AIRCRAFT_CODE = 'M80';
```

This query selects all columns (`*`) from the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` matches 'M80'. Adjust the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` value as needed if the code for the M80 is different in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT *

Question: what is the seating capacity of the M80
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "M80" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the seating capacity of the M80 aircraft, you would typically need to search for the corresponding aircraft code in the `AIRCRAFT` table. Assuming "M80" refers to a specific aircraft model and that the relevant aircraft code is also "M80", the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_CODE = 'M80';
```

This query selects the `CAPACITY` of the aircraft from the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` matches 'M80'. If "M80" is not the exact code used in your database, you should replace it with the correct code.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_CODE = 'M80';

Raw LLM Response:
To write the SQL query for one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando after 18:00 on Wednesday, you'll need to join the relevant tables and filter according to the specified criteria. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00' 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY' 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: To ensure that each flight ID returned is unique.
- **FROM**: This section includes multiple table joins necessary to access city names, airports, and the flights between them.
- **WHERE**:
  - Checks if the origin city is Milwaukee and the destination city is Orlando.
  - Ensures the flight departs after 18:00.
  - Verifies the day of the week is Wednesday.
  - Matches the day and month criteria to ensure we are dealing with the correct flight date based on your conditions.

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with actual values representing the date for the query to work properly.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from SEATTLE to CHICAGO that have meals on CO Saturday morning, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE = "CO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN morning_start_time AND morning_end_time;
```

### Explanation:
1. We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for both source (SEATTLE) and destination (CHICAGO) airports.
2. We ensure the cities match SEATTLE and CHICAGO.
3. We check that the flights originate from the airport in SEATTLE and arrive at the airport in CHICAGO.
4. We join with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to filter out flights with meals available based on their `MEAL_CODE`.
5. We check the specified day (CO, which likely represents Saturday) and ensure that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` matches.
6. We include a condition for the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to only include flights that depart on Saturday morning (you would need to define `morning_start_time` and `morning_end_time`).

Make sure you replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, `year0`, `morning_start_time`, and `morning_end_time` with actual values based on your specific requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the flights from Chicago to Seattle on Continental Airlines (CO) that have meals early Saturday morning, you'll need to ensure you're checking the flight information against the relevant conditions such as flight days, meal codes for flights that include meals, and the specified departure time.

Here's how you can construct your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "Saturday"
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Joined**: The query involves joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FOOD_SERVICE`, `DATE_DAY`, and `DAYS` tables to gather all necessary information.
- **Filters**:
  - Searching for flights specifically from Chicago to Seattle on Continental Airlines (CO).
  - Matching the meal service code to ensure meals are included.
  - Filtering for flights that are scheduled early Saturday morning, with `DEPARTURE_TIME` being between midnight and 9 AM.
- **Distinct Flights**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that the same flight does not appear multiple times in the result.

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values representing the specific date you are interested in querying.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a combination of Continental Airlines (CO) flights from Chicago to Seattle that have meals early on Saturday morning, you would typically join various tables to filter based on the departure city, destination city, airline code, and meal code. Here's an SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" 
    AND DAYOFWEEK(FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 7 -- Assuming 7 represents Saturday in your system
    AND (FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '12:00:00') -- Early morning on Saturday
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%SAT%'; -- Ensure it operates on Saturdays
```

### Explanation:
- **AIRPORT_SERVICE**: Used to find the airport codes for Chicago and Seattle.
- **CITY**: Matches the city names to get their corresponding city codes.
- **FLIGHT**: Retrieves flights that match the departure and arrival airports.
- **FOOD_SERVICE**: Checks for the meals available on the flights.
- **WHERE clause**: 
  - Filters for flights operated by Continental Airlines (CO).
  - Ensures the flight departs early Saturday morning.
  - Checks that the flight is scheduled to operate on Saturdays.

Make sure to adapt any specific date and time functions (like `DAYOFWEEK`) according to your SQL dialect, as this can differ between SQL variants.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Saturday morning flights for the airline code "CO" that offer meals from Chicago to Minneapolis, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE

  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN "05:00:00" AND "12:00:00" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting DISTINCT FLIGHT_ID**: This selects unique flight IDs for the output.
2. **JOIN Conditions**: It joins various tables like `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FOOD_SERVICE`, based on the city names and airport codes.
3. **CITY Filtering**: It filters for flights departing from "CHICAGO" and arriving at "MINNEAPOLIS".
4. **Airline Criteria**: It checks that the airline code is "CO".
5. **Day and Time Filtering**:
   - It specifies that the flight is on Saturday.
   - It limits the departure times to the range between 5:00 AM and 12:00 PM (representing morning).
6. **Meal Service**: It ensures that the flights have an associated meal code in the `FOOD_SERVICE` table.

This query will retrieve the relevant flight IDs based on the specified criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve Saturday morning flights from Chicago to St. Paul on a specific airline (CO) that include meals, we can construct an SQL query that leverages the available tables in your database schema. Here's how the SQL could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables are joined to filter flights from "CHICAGO" to "ST. PAUL".
2. **Day Filter**: The `DAYS` table filters for Saturday flights by checking if `DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY"`.
3. **Time Filter**: The query checks if the `DEPARTURE_TIME` falls within the range typically considered "morning" (05:00 AM to 11:59 AM).
4. **Meal Inclusion**: The `FOOD_SERVICE` table is joined to filter flights that have meals.
5. **Airline Filter**: The query filters for flights operated by airline "CO".

Make sure to adjust the time range or other filters based on your specific needs or definitions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the available flights from MILWAUKEE to ST. LOUIS that leave on Monday night, you can utilize a SQL query similar to the one for the Boston to Washington flights, but updated to reflect the specific cities and schedule you described. Here’s an appropriate SQL query for your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- Replace with the actual day number for Monday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Replace with the actual month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace with the actual year
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '23:59:59'; -- Adjust time range as needed for Monday night
```

This query assumes you're looking for flights leaving on Monday evening (between 6 PM and midnight). You must replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the specific values corresponding to the Monday for which you want to check for flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights leaving Tuesday night from St. Louis to Burbank, you can construct a SQL query similar to the ones provided in your previous questions. Here’s how it can be structured:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '20:00:00' AND '23:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: The query lists the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, `FLIGHT`) and creates aliases for readability.
   
2. **City and Airport Filters**: It filters for flights departing from "ST. LOUIS" and arriving in "BURBANK" by matching `CITY_NAME` with their respective `CITY_CODE`.

3. **Date Information**: Adjust `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` to reflect the specific Tuesday of interest. 

4. **Flight Days Matching**: Ensures the flight corresponds to the correct day by integrating `FLIGHT_DAYS` with date information.

5. **Time Window**: The `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition ensures you're only selecting flights that leave between 8 PM and midnight on Tuesday.

Ensure that the specific values for `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` for the upcoming Tuesday are appropriately set in the query according to your requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a return flight from Miami to JFK, you will need to query the database for flights from Miami to JFK and then for flights returning from JFK to Miami. Here is how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHT1.FLIGHT_ID AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHT2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_MIA,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICE_JFK,
     CITY AS CITY_MIA,
     CITY AS CITY_JFK,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHT2
WHERE CITY_MIA.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_MIA.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_MIA.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND CITY_JFK.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE_JFK.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITY_JFK.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND FLIGHT1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_MIA.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_JFK.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHT2.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_JFK.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHT2.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICE_MIA.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs for both the departure flight from Miami to JFK (`FLIGHT1`) and the return flight from JFK to Miami (`FLIGHT2`).
- It joins the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`) to ensure that we are only considering flights originating from the correct cities and airports.
- Modify `"NEW YORK"` to whatever the actual CITY_NAME for JFK is if required in your data.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from PHOENIX to MILWAUKEE on Wednesday for the airline "AA," you would need to structure your SQL query to join the necessary tables and filter based on the provided criteria. Here is how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA";
```

In this SQL query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the relevant tables.
- We filter for the departure city (PHOENIX) and arrival city (MILWAUKEE).
- We check that the day of the week is Wednesday.
- Lastly, we filter based on the airline code for American Airlines, which is commonly represented as "AA."

Raw LLM Response:
To write a SQL query that retrieves Saturday flights from Milwaukee to Phoenix on American Airlines (AA), you would typically need to join several tables to filter for the right conditions. Here's an SQL query that does just that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Table Aliases**: The `AS` keyword is used to create simpler names (aliases) for tables used in the `FROM` clause.
2. **City Filtering**: It checks that the cities correspond to Milwaukee and Phoenix, using `CITY_NAME`.
3. **Airport Services**: The query links the relevant airport codes based on the cities.
4. **Day Filtering**: It ensures that the flight operates on Saturday by checking against the `DAYS` table.
5. **Airline Filtering**: It checks that the airline code equals "AA" for American Airlines.
6. **Flight Days Matching**: It ensures that the flight is available on the specified day.

Make sure that the columns `FLIGHT_DAYS` and `AIRLINE_CODE` exist in your `FLIGHT` table structure for the query to work correctly. Adjust accordingly if the actual database schema has different field names.

Raw LLM Response:
To write an SQL query for booking a flight from Cincinnati to New York on United Airlines (UA) for next Saturday, you need to join the necessary tables while ensuring to filter for flights that match your criteria. Below is a suggested SQL query that aims to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'  -- filtering by United Airlines
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = next_saturday_day_number  -- Replace with the day number for next Saturday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = next_saturday_month_number  -- Replace with the month number for next Saturday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = next_saturday_year  -- Replace with the year for next Saturday
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **Filtering by City:** The query joins `CITY`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, to correlate city names with airport codes.
- **Flight Selection:** It looks for flights from Cincinnati to New York and checks for the specific airline code (in this case, "UA" for United Airlines).
- **Next Saturday Date:** You'll need to compute or replace `next_saturday_day_number`, `next_saturday_month_number`, and `next_saturday_year` with the actual date values accordingly.
- **Day Checking:** It ensures that the flight days match the day of the week requirements.

You will likely need to calculate the date for the next Saturday programmatically in your application and pass those parameters to your SQL query.

Raw LLM Response:
To find all the round trip flights from Burbank to Milwaukee that stop in St. Louis, you would need to join the relevant tables, ensuring you include the necessary criteria. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias2, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 1 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN 
          (SELECT FLIGHT_STOP.FLIGHT_ID 
           FROM FLIGHT_STOP 
           WHERE FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Distinct Flight IDs**: We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each flight ID is unique in the results.
2. **Join with Necessary Tables**: The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined multiple times to relate the city names (Burbank, Milwaukee, St. Louis) to their respective airport codes, and the `FLIGHT` table is used to get the flight information.
3. **Stopping Criterion**: The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 1` ensures that only flights with one stop (which would be St. Louis) are selected.
4. **Subquery for Stops**: The subquery checks if St. Louis is among the stops for the selected flights.

This query provides you with all the relevant round-trip flights between Burbank and Milwaukee that stop in St. Louis. Adjust the definitions of stops as needed based on the data and the design of your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest round-trip fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 25th, you'll want to join multiple tables to get the relevant fare information while ensuring the specified conditions for the fare basis and the route are met. 

Here's a possible SQL query that meets this requirement:

```sql
SELECT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, 
       MIN(FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS CHEAPEST_ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 25
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 12
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- Replace year0 with the specific year of interest
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"
GROUP BY FAREalias0.FARE_ID
ORDER BY CHEAPEST_ROUND_TRIP_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Key Points:
1. **Dates**: The query specifically looks for flights available on December 25th, so make sure to replace `year0` with the appropriate year you are interested in.
2. **Join Conditions**: The query ensures it connects all relevant entities like cities, airport services, fares, and flight details.
3. **Filtering for Round Trip**: The condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"` ensures that only round-trip fares are considered.
4. **Aggregating Fares**: It uses `MIN` to get the cheapest fare cost.
5. **Minimum Result**: The result is ordered by cost in ascending order and limited to one result to get the cheapest fare.

This query will give you the cheapest round-trip fare between Indianapolis and Orlando on the specified date.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve FIRST class flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI that are round trip, you can use the following SQL query. This will join the relevant airport services, cities, flights, and fare details, filtering for FIRST class bookings and ensuring the fare requires a round trip.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES" 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN (
      SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE 
      FROM FARE_BASIS 
      WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST"
  );
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joins**: We are using inner joins between `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` to connect all the necessary tables.
2. **FILTERS**:
   - We filter the source city as "NEW YORK" and the destination city as "MIAMI".
   - We ensure the flight and fare correspond to the correct airports.
   - We only select fares that are marked as round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"`).
   - To filter for FIRST class, we check that the fare basis corresponds to FIRST class bookings by checking the `FARE_BASIS` table.

This query will provide you with all the necessary flight IDs that fulfill the requirements for round-trip FIRST class flights between the specified cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the first-class flights from New York to Miami that are round-trip, the SQL query would look like the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES" 
  AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN (SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE FROM FARE_BASIS WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST");
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The query uses inner joins to link `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both source and destination, `CITY` for the city names, `FARE` for fare information, and `FLIGHT` for retrieving flight details.
2. **City Filters**: We filter on the city names to ensure flights are from "NEW YORK" to "MIAMI".
3. **Airports and Flights**: The query ensures that the flights operate from the selected airports by referencing the corresponding airport codes.
4. **Round Trip Requirement**: We check that the fare requires a round trip.
5. **First Class Filtering**: Finally, we check that the booking class corresponds to "FIRST". 

Make sure to replace the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` and `FARE_BASIS_CODE` checks according to the actual table structure or values if they differ in your database.

Question: list the AS flights arriving in BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the AS (Alaska Airlines) flights arriving in Burbank, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS";
```

This query retrieves the distinct flight IDs of Alaska Airlines flights (where `AIRLINE_CODE` is "AS") that are arriving at Burbank (where the city code corresponds to Burbank's airport service). Adjustments might be necessary depending on your specific schema constraints.

Question: list airports
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all the airports, you would typically perform a query that selects all relevant fields from the `AIRPORT` table. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM AIRPORT;
```

If you want to return specific fields, such as the airport code and name, you can specify those fields as follows:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME FROM AIRPORT;
```

This will return a list of all airports along with their codes and names from the database.

SELECT * FROM AIRPORT;

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for a flight departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesday after 18:00, you can use a SQL query similar to the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY' 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

Here's a breakdown of the key components of this SQL query:
- It first filters for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee.
- It checks the day of the week to ensure it's Wednesday.
- It ensures that the departure time is after 18:00.
- Finally, it retrieves distinct flight IDs along with some additional flight information.

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values representing the actual date of the upcoming Wednesday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesday after 17:00 (5 PM), you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the necessary tables and apply the required filters for the departure location, destination, day of the week, and time.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00'
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

**Explanation:**
- The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that we retrieve unique flight information.
- The query joins the relevant tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for airport information, `CITY` to filter by city names, `DATE_DAY` to specify the day, `DAYS` to align with flight days, and `FLIGHT` to extract flight details.
- The conditions ensure we fetch flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesday after 5 PM (17:00).

To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesday after 5 PM (1700 hours), you can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, CITY AS CITYalias0, CITY AS CITYalias1, DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, DAYS AS DAYSalias0, FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0

AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '1700');
```

### Notes:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the respective numerical values for Wednesday's date when you plan to run this query.
- The query selects distinct flight IDs, flight numbers, departure times, arrival times, and airline codes for clarity in your output. Adjust as necessary if you require additional data columns.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Salt Lake City (SLC) to Phoenix (PHX) departing on Wednesday after 1700, you would need to join the relevant tables to filter the flights accordingly. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00' 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE = 'WED';  -- assuming the days code for Wednesday is 'WED'
```

### Explanation:
- The query uses several joins to connect the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables.
- It filters for flights originating from Salt Lake City and arriving in Phoenix.
- It checks the day of travel (Wednesday) and that the departure time is after 5:00 PM.
- Note that `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` need to be replaced with the actual numeric values for the current date when the query is executed.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on Wednesday departing after 18:00, we need to structure the SQL query to access the necessary tables and filter the results based on the specified conditions. Here’s the SQL statement that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- replace with the actual day number for Wednesday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- replace with the actual month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- replace with the actual year
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00';  -- ensure time format is as per the database
```

### Key Adjustments Made:
1. **City Names:** Filtered by `CITY_NAME` for "OAKLAND" and "SALT LAKE CITY".
2. **Airports:** Linked `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` to their respective airport codes.
3. **Date Conditions:** Applied the `DAY_NUMBER`, `MONTH_NUMBER`, and `YEAR` filters to ensure the flights are on the specified Wednesday.
4. **Time Filtering:** Added a condition for `DEPARTURE_TIME` to be after '18:00:00'.

### Note:
Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with actual values representing the specific Wednesday for which you want to check the flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from New York to Nashville that are leaving after 5:00 PM (17:00) on Wednesday, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = <DAY_NUMBER_FOR_WEDNESDAY> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = <MONTH_NUMBER_FOR_WEDNESDAY> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = <YEAR_FOR_WEDNESDAY> 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00';
```

Replace `<DAY_NUMBER_FOR_WEDNESDAY>`, `<MONTH_NUMBER_FOR_WEDNESDAY>`, and `<YEAR_FOR_WEDNESDAY>` with the actual values corresponding to the specific Wednesday you are interested in querying. 

This query checks the flights from New York to Nashville, ensuring they depart after 5 PM on a specified Wednesday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight and airline information for a flight from Denver to Salt Lake City on a Monday, departing after 5:00 PM, you could structure your SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME, 
    FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
    CITY AS CITYalias0,
    CITY AS CITYalias1,
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,

    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **From clause**: The query joins the relevant tables including `AIRPORT_SERVICE` for both departure and arrival cities, `CITY` for city names, `FLIGHT` for flight details, and `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` for ensuring the flight aligns with a Monday.
2. **Where clause**: Filters ensure that the flight departs from Denver, flies to Salt Lake City, departs after 5:00 PM, and is indeed scheduled for a Monday.
3. **Select clause**: Retrieves the distinct `FLIGHT_ID`, flight number, airline code, airline name, and departure time.

Ensure you replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with appropriate values based on the current date or the desired date.

Question: list all flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights arriving in Denver between 2000 and 2100, you would need to specify the relevant tables that contain the arrival time and the destination airport code for Denver. Assuming the relevant columns in the `FLIGHT` table include `ARRIVAL_TIME` and `TO_AIRPORT`, along with the appropriate airport code for Denver, the SQL query can be formulated as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
)
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000:00' AND '2100:00';
```

This query does the following:
1. It selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. It filters the flights where `TO_AIRPORT` matches the airport code for Denver obtained from the `AIRPORT` table.
3. It constrains the arrival time to be between 2000 and 2100 (assuming the time format is in HH:MM). Adjust the format as necessary if you have a different time representation in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
)
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000:00' AND '2100:00';

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights arriving in Denver between the time range of 20:00 (8:00 PM) and 21:00 (9:00 PM), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID

    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
    FROM AIRPORT 
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
) 
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
- We are filtering for flights that arrive at the airport code corresponding to Denver.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100'` ensures we only get flights arriving within that specified time range.

Question: list all flights on all types of aircraft arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights arriving in Denver between 2000 and 2100, you need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to ensure you're filtering for flights arriving at the airport in Denver. You should also specify the time range for the arrival time.

Here’s the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER') 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID:** This selects unique flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0:** This indicates that we're querying from the `FLIGHT` table.
3. **WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'):** This subquery checks for the airport code for Denver, ensuring that only flights arriving in Denver are selected.
4. **AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100':** This condition restricts the results to those flights that have an arrival time between 2000 hours (8 PM) and 2100 hours (9 PM). 

Make sure the time format used corresponds to how the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is stored in your database (e.g., in 24-hour format). If the time is stored differently (e.g., as `HH:MM`), adjust the values accordingly (e.g., `BETWEEN '20:00' AND '21:00'`).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER') 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100';

      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND (CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK' OR CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'JAMAICA' OR CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK') -- Include other relevant New York area cities
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = <day_number_next_saturday> -- Replace <day_number_next_saturday> with the actual day number

      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

**Notes:**
- Ensure you replace `<day_number_next_saturday>`, `<month_number_next_saturday>`, and `<year_next_saturday>` with the actual values for next Saturday's date.
- Depending on your requirements, modify the condition for the arrival cities in the `NEW YORK` area as necessary.
- Make sure the arrival time comparison format aligns with your database's time format.

Question: list distance from airports to downtown in NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.MILES_DISTANT FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the distances from airports to downtown in New York, we will utilize the `AIRPORT` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables. We'll filter by the `CITY_CODE` corresponding to New York (from the `CITY` table) and gather relevant distance data from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table.

Here's the SQL query you can use for that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_SERVICE.MILES_DISTANT
FROM AIRPORT 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK";
```

This query performs the following actions:
1. Joins the `AIRPORT` table with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table based on `AIRPORT_CODE`.
2. Joins the `CITY` table to filter results specifically for New York City.
3. Selects the names of the airports and their respective distances to downtown (as indicated by `MILES_DISTANT`).

Raw LLM Response:
To list the WEDNESDAY night flights from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY, you would need to construct an SQL query that includes the necessary conditions to filter by the specific day (WEDNESDAY) and consider what is defined as "night" for the flights. Typically, night flights are considered to be flights that depart after a certain time in the evening, such as 8 PM (20:00) or 9 PM (21:00).

Assuming we define night flights as any departure time after 8 PM, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '20:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `FROM` and `TO` airports are filtered using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to ensure we are only considering flights from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY.
- We filter for flights that depart on WEDNESDAY and check if their departure time is equal to or later than 8 PM. Adjust the departure time as necessary based on your specific definition of "night."

```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: The query joins several tables to link the relevant information about cities, airports, flights, and days.
2. **WHERE Conditions**:
    - It filters out flights from MEMPHIS to NEW YORK.
    - It checks the day of the week to be MONDAY.
    - It also filters the departure time to be in the evening, between 6 PM and midnight (`'18:00:00' AND '23:59:59'`).
3. **DISTINCT**: The query ensures that each flight ID is only returned once.

### Explanation:
- This query joins the necessary tables to find flights from Indianapolis to Memphis.
- The query checks that the departure time is before 10:00 AM.
- It filters for first-class tickets by checking the `BOOKING_CLASS` in the `FARE_BASIS` table to ensure it equals "FIRST".
- It also specifies that the fare must not require a round trip, ensuring we get one-way results. 

Make sure to adjust the time format according to your database settings if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all nonstop round trip flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI, you will need to construct a SQL query that joins the relevant tables. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID <> FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0  -- Ensure nonstop flights
  AND FLIGHTalias1.STOPS = 0  -- Ensure nonstop return flights
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_DAYS;  -- Ensure flight days match for round trip
```

### Explanation:
- The query uses two instances of the `FLIGHT` table to get both the outgoing and return flights.
- The `STOPS = 0` condition ensures that only nonstop flights are considered.
- The query checks that both flights correspond to the same dates using `FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_DAYS`.
- The `DISTINCT` clause is used to avoid duplicate flight entries.

Make sure to replace `"NEW YORK"` and `"MIAMI"` with the exact city names as they are stored in the database if they differ in any minor way (e.g., if there's space or punctuation).

        AND FLIGHTalias1.STOPS = 0  -- Return flights must also be nonstop
  ) 
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM_CLAUSE**: We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to find flights from Miami to New York.
2. **WHERE_CLAUSE**: We specify the `CITY_NAME` for Miami and New York to link them to their respective airports.
3. **NONSTOP FLIGHTS**: The `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` condition ensures that we are only selecting nonstop flights in both directions.
4. **ROUND TRIP**: We use a subquery to select the corresponding return flights from New York to Miami ensuring that it also adheres to the nonstop condition. 

This query will give you all the round trip nonstop flights from Miami to New York and back.

Question: get flight from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO stopping at DTW
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "DTW" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves flights from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO with a stop at DTW (Detroit Metropolitan Airport), you would need to incorporate the relevant tables and structure the query to account for the flight legs. 

Here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT_LEG AS FLIGHT_LEGalias0 ON FLIGHT_LEGalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" 
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
AND FLIGHT_LEGalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = "DTW";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - `FLIGHT`: To get the flight details.
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE`: Provides the mappings between cities and their respective airports.
   - `CITY`: Provides the city names.
   - `FLIGHT_LEG`: Connects flights with any specified stopover airports.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The origin city (`TORONTO`) and destination city (`SAN DIEGO`) are specified by joining with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
   - The filter on `FLIGHT_LEG` ensures that any leg of the flight must include a stop at `DTW`.

### Note:
Ensure that `DTW` is a valid airport code in your database for this query to return results effectively.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

Question: list all AS flights
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights operated by American Airlines (which commonly uses the code "AS"), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'AS', which represents American Airlines. Make sure to replace 'AS' with the actual airline code for the specific airline you want to list if "AS" refers to a different airline in your context.

Question: how many flights does AS have to BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the number of flights that Alaska Airlines (AS) has to Burbank, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table filtered by the airline code for Alaska Airlines and the airport code for Burbank. 

Assuming "BURBANK" refers to the city name, you'll first need to find the airport code associated with Burbank. This can usually be obtained from the `AIRPORT` table.

Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS'
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK';
```

### Explanation:
- The `JOIN` statements ensure you're linking the `FLIGHT` data to the corresponding `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` to get the destination city for flights.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that you're looking for flights where the airline code is 'AS' (Alaska Airlines) and the destination city is 'BURBANK'.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID)` counts the unique flight IDs to provide the number of distinct flights. 

Make sure to replace "BURBANK" with the correct airport code if needed, as sometimes the airport might be referenced by its airport code instead (for example, BUR for Bob Hope Airport in Burbank). If you're unsure of the airport code for Burbank, you can execute the below query first to find it:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
FROM AIRPORT 
WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK';
```

It will give you the exact airport code to use in the first query, if necessary.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS'
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK';

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "JFK" AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show Delta Airlines (DL) flights from JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) to Miami, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "JFK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL";
```

### Explanation:
- The `FROM` clause joins multiple tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`.
- Filters are applied to select records where:
  - The departure airport is JFK (associated with New York).
  - The destination is Miami.
  - The airline code is "DL" for Delta Airlines.
- The results will return distinct flight IDs for DL flights from JFK to Miami.

      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting DISTINCT FLIGHT_ID**: To ensure unique flight IDs in the result.
- **Joining tables**: Join `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` to correlate information about flights from Milwaukee to Phoenix.
- **City filtering**: The city names "MILWAUKEE" and "PHOENIX" are specified to find the appropriate airport codes.
- **Days Filtering**: We check if the flights are scheduled on either "SATURDAY" or "SUNDAY."
- **Airline Filtering**: We filter for flights that are operated by American Airlines, represented by the airline code "AA."
  
This query effectively captures the required flights given the stated conditions.

Question: i need an early flight from MILWAUKEE to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find early flights from Milwaukee to Denver, you typically want to query for flights that depart at a time earlier in the day. Assuming "early flight" means before a specific cutoff time (like noon), you can define an appropriate time range for that.

Here’s how you can construct the SQL query to get the desired flights:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **FROM Clauses and City Codes**: It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to ensure it selects flights that meet the criteria set for both Milwaukee and Denver.
- **WHERE Conditions**:
  - It checks that the source city is Milwaukee and the destination city is Denver.
  - It filters for flights departing from Milwaukee (using the appropriate airport code) to Denver.
  - The query filters only for flights with a departure time before noon (12:00:00).

### Note:
- Make sure to adjust the `DEPARTURE_TIME` format according to your database's requirements (for example, it might be stored as a string or a time type).
- You can adjust the cutoff time in the `AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'` condition depending on what you classify as "early."

Raw LLM Response:
To list afternoon flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves distinct flight IDs for flights from ST. PETERSBURG to CHARLOTTE that have departure times in the afternoon (typically considered to be between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM). 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

### Key Points:
1. The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table for matching airport services based on the destination and departure cities.
2. It includes a condition that filters flights based on their departure times for the time range defined as the afternoon.
3. Adjust the time range if your definition of "afternoon" differs.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from CHICAGO to KANSAS CITY in the morning, you can use a SQL query that selects from the relevant tables while filtering for flights that depart during morning hours (typically defined as departures from 5:00 AM to 11:59 AM). Here is a sample SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

This query accomplishes the following:

- It joins necessary tables to relate cities to their associated airports and flights.
- It filters for flights originating from CHICAGO and heading to KANSAS CITY.
- It specifies the time range for morning departures. 

Adjust the time range as needed based on your local definitions of morning if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve morning flights from Baltimore to Newark, you need to specify the relevant parameters in your SQL query. Below is an example SQL query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID` values from flights departing from Baltimore to Newark.
- It joins the relevant tables for cities and airport services.
- The `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition is set to filter for times between 6 AM and 11:59 AM to capture all morning flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find morning flights from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES, you need to join the relevant tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, and FLIGHT) and specify the timing criteria for morning flights. Assuming "morning" generally refers to times between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM, your SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

This query selects distinct flight IDs for flights departing from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES that occur in the morning range specified. Adjust the time conditions as necessary based on the specific definition of a "morning flight".

In this query:
- We're selecting distinct flight IDs.
- We're joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables.
- We ensure the correct origin and destination cities are matched, namely "NEWARK" and "LOS ANGELES".
- We filter for flights that depart after 5 PM by specifying `FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00'`. 

You can adjust the time limit in `DEPARTURE_TIME` to suit your specific definition of evening if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
Here's the SQL query that retrieves all flights from Denver to St. Louis on Tuesday morning:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,

      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **City and Airport Mapping**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to find the correct airports for Denver and St. Louis.
2. **Date and Day Check**: The query checks that the day is Tuesday, ensuring the appropriate flights are selected.
3. **Departure Time Range**: The query specifies that the departure time should be between 6 AM and 12 PM, which represents typical morning hours. Adjust the time range as necessary to fit the definition of “Tuesday morning.”
4. **Distinct Flights**: The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that duplicate flights are eliminated from the results. 

Make sure to adjust the time intervals based on your specific requirements for what constitutes "Tuesday morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from PITTSBURGH to NEWARK on Monday morning, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects distinct flight IDs where the departure is from the airport associated with PITTSBURGH and the arrival is at the airport associated with NEWARK, while also filtering for Monday morning departures.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- Replace with actual day number for Monday
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Replace with actual month number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace with actual year
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'; -- Adjust time range for Monday morning
```

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values for the intended Monday. The time range for `DEPARTURE_TIME` is set to between `06:00:00` and `12:00:00` to capture morning flights. Adjust this as needed based on your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query to find flights from PITTSBURGH to LOS ANGELES on Thursday evening, you'll first need to determine the departure times that consider "evening" to be the hours you're interested in (commonly around 5 PM onwards). Here's an example SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "THURSDAY" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '23:59:59' 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

- **FROM**: The query joins several tables: `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` to gather all necessary data regarding the flights.
  
- **WHERE Conditions**:
  - It filters based on the originating city ("PITTSBURGH") and the destination city ("LOS ANGELES").
  - It checks the day of the week to ensure it's Thursday.
  - The `DEPARTURE_TIME` is filtered to include only those flights that depart in the evening (from 5 PM to midnight).

- **DISTINCT**: This ensures that you receive unique flight IDs in case there are multiple entries for the same flight.

### Note: 
Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for the specific date you're interested in querying.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from TAMPA to CHARLOTTE on Sunday morning, you can construct the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY" 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- replace with the desired day number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- replace with the desired month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- replace with the desired year
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'; -- Assuming morning flights are before noon
```

In this query:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values for the upcoming Sunday you are interested in.
- The time window for departure is set between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM to capture morning flights. Adjust this as needed based on what defines "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from BALTIMORE to NEWARK on Wednesday morning, you would need to specify a time range that represents "morning." For example, you might consider morning to be from 5:00 AM to 11:59 AM. 

Below is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

In this query:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values for the specific Wednesday you are looking for.
- The time range for departures is set from 5:00 AM to 11:59 AM, but this can be adjusted based on your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from MIAMI to CLEVELAND on a Sunday afternoon, we can use a SQL query similar to your previous examples. We will need to join the relevant tables for AIRPORT_SERVICE and CITY, and filter the results based on the day being "Sunday" and the departure time being in the afternoon.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY" 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- you will need to input the actual day number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- you will need to input the actual month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- you will need to input the actual year
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN "12:00:00" AND "17:59:59"; -- Assuming "afternoon" is between noon and 5:59 PM
```

### Notes:
1. **Input Dates**: Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for the Sunday you are looking for.
2. **Departure Time**: The range for "afternoon" is set from noon (`12:00:00`) to just before 6 PM (`17:59:59`).
3. **Ensure Data Availability**: Make sure that the necessary data is populated in the database for the given cities and flights to retrieve meaningful results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS on Sunday afternoon, you will need to join the relevant tables just like in the previous examples. We'll assume you want flights departing on Sunday, and "afternoon" typically refers to a time range between 12:00 PM (12:00) and 6:00 PM (18:00).

Here’s an SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- replace year0 with the actual year
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- replace month_number0 with the actual month
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- replace day_number0 with the actual day
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00'
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `year0`, `month_number0`, and `day_number0` with the actual year, month, and day for the upcoming Sunday you want to query.
- Make sure to adjust the time range for "afternoon" if you intend to define it differently.

Raw LLM Response:
To get the flights from New York to Las Vegas on Sunday afternoon, you would structure the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY" 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- **CITY Names and Codes**: It checks for the source city (NEW YORK) and destination (LAS VEGAS) using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
- **Day of Departure**: It ensures the `DAY_NAME` is set to "SUNDAY".
- **Departure Time**: The time range is specified to capture flights that depart in the afternoon (between 12 PM and 6 PM).
- **Flight Day Constraint**: It also ensures that the flight is scheduled on the appropriate day of the week based on the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field.

### Note:
Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values corresponding to the specific Sunday you are querying the flights for.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Chicago to Seattle on Saturday morning, you would need to consider the relevant tables for airports, cities, and flights, as well as any relevant date and time information. Based on your previous queries, here’s how the SQL could look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- Assuming you specify the actual day number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Assuming you specify the actual month number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- Assuming you specify the actual year
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN morning_start_time AND morning_end_time; -- Specify morning time bounds
```

In this query:

- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with actual values corresponding to the intended Saturday.
- Replace `morning_start_time` and `morning_end_time` with specific time values indicating the morning period in which you are interested (e.g., `06:00:00` to `12:00:00` for Saturday morning).

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from CHICAGO to LAS VEGAS on a Saturday morning, you need to consider several aspects: 

1. Look for flights from Chicago to Las Vegas.
2. Filter them by flight details to focus on Saturday morning.

Here’s how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We select distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to get the associated airports for the departure and arrival cities.
- We join the `CITY` table to filter based on city names.
- We add a condition to filter for flights that operate on Saturdays by using the `DAYS` table.
- We specify the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to be within the morning range. The example uses `'06:00:00'` to `'12:00:00'` to cover the morning hours but can be adjusted based on your definition of "Saturday morning."

To find flights from PITTSBURGH to LOS ANGELES on Thursday evening, you can use the following SQL query. Note that you need to determine the specific date and define what constitutes "evening" in terms of the time range. Assuming evening is between 6 PM (18:00) and 11:59 PM (23:59) on Thursday, you need to determine the current date and calculate for the upcoming Thursday.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights from Nashville to Memphis on Monday morning, the SQL query will look for flights departing from the airport servicing Nashville to the airport servicing Memphis, while also ensuring that the flight departs on a Monday morning. 

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- You need to specify the required day number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- You need to specify the required month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- You need to specify the required year
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';  -- Assuming morning is defined as between 6 AM and 12 PM
```

In this query, you'll want to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values for the specific date of the trip. The time range for morning can also be adjusted according to your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from NASHVILLE to MEMPHIS on a Monday morning, you would need to construct a SQL query similar to the previous examples. The query will involve the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `DATE_DAY`, and `DAYS` tables. Here's how you might write that query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59';  -- Assuming morning is defined as 6 AM to 11:59 AM
```

### Explanation:
- `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables are joined to find relevant routes and flights.
- We filter for flights originating from NASHVILLE and destined for MEMPHIS.
- We're also checking that the day is Monday (`DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY"`) and that the departure time falls within the morning hours (between 6 AM and 12 PM). Adjust the time range according to your definition of "morning".

Raw LLM Response:
To fetch the flights from INDIANAPOLIS to TORONTO for Thursday morning, you would need to consider the relevant city names, airport services, and conditions of the flight schedule for Thursday morning (which requires time constraints). Below is a possible SQL query that encapsulates these requirements:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO"

  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = <day_number_for_thursday> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = <month_number_for_current_month> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = <current_year> 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN <morning_start_time> AND <morning_end_time>;
```

### In the SQL Query:
- Replace `<day_number_for_thursday>` with the actual day number corresponding to Thursday.
- Replace `<month_number_for_current_month>` with the month number of your current month.
- Replace `<current_year>` with the current year.
- Set the `<morning_start_time>` and `<morning_end_time>` to define the range for "Thursday morning," for instance, from 06:00 to 12:00.

This query combines various tables to check for available flights leaving from Indianapolis to Toronto on a Thursday morning.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Toronto to Montreal on Friday morning, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects distinct flight IDs based on the specified criteria and utilizes the necessary relationships among the tables:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "FRIDAY" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'; -- Assuming morning is defined as 6 AM to 12 PM
```

### Explanation:
- The query is selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table based on several conditions.
- It checks that Toronto and Montreal are the source and destination cities, respectively.
- It ensures that the day of travel is Friday by checking against the `DAY_NAME`.
- The `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition is set to capture flights departing in the morning, which is assumed here as between 6 AM and 12 PM, but you may adjust this range based on your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To find a morning flight from Burbank to Milwaukee on next Monday, you would need to consider flights that depart in the morning hours. Let's assume "morning" refers to flights departing between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM. You'll also need the appropriate date and day information for next Monday.

Here’s the SQL query you could use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number_next_monday 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number_next_monday 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year_next_monday 
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

In this SQL query:
- Replace `day_number_next_monday`, `month_number_next_monday`, and `year_next_monday` with the actual values corresponding to the date of next Monday.
- We check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is between '06:00:00' and '12:00:00' to ensure it's a morning flight.

LOUIS" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from ST. LOUIS to BURBANK that leaves on Tuesday afternoon, you can use the following SQL query. The query specifically retrieves flights departing from the ST. LOUIS airport to the BURBANK airport during the afternoon hours on Tuesday.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59' 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE = "TUESDAY";
```

### Explanation:
- **JOIN CONDITIONS**: This query joins various tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, DATE_DAY, DAYS, and FLIGHT) based on the relevant city names and airport codes.
- **CITY and AIRPORT FILTERS**: It filters to only include flights departing from ST. LOUIS and arriving at BURBANK.
- **DEPARTURE TIME**: It filters the departure time to be between `12:00:00` (noon) and `17:59:59` (before 6 PM), which represents the typical afternoon travel window.
- **DAY OF THE WEEK**: It also ensures that the day of the week is Tuesday.

To execute this SQL query, you would need to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, `year0`, and ensure that the proper logic is applied based on the actual day and date for Tuesday according to your application logic or variables.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from SAN DIEGO to PHOENIX on Monday morning, you will need to create a SQL query that selects the relevant flights based on the airport services linked to the cities, while also filtering for flights specifically on Monday and during the morning hours. Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:
- The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to retrieve unique flight IDs.
- The `FROM` clause joins multiple tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT`) to gather necessary information.
- The `WHERE` clause contains several conditions:
  - It checks if "SAN DIEGO" and "PHOENIX" are matched correctly in their respective CITY tables.
  - It ensures that the flights are indeed departing from the correct airports as per the service definitions.
  - It specifies that the flights should be on "MONDAY".
  - The time condition (`FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59'`) restricts the results to flights scheduled in the morning.

Modify the time range in the `BETWEEN` clause as necessary to match your definition of "morning" if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve either the last flight from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on Wednesday or the first flight from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on Thursday, you can use the following SQL query. This query will look for flights on both days, ordering appropriately to get the last flight on Wednesday and the first flight on Thursday.

```sql

       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
       AND (

              AND FLIGHTsub.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '23:59:59' 
              AND FLIGHTsub.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE)) 
            OR 
            (DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "THURSDAY" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = 
             (SELECT MIN(DEPARTURE_TIME) 
              FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTsub 
              WHERE FLIGHTsub.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
              AND FLIGHTsub.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE

            )
       )
      )

AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER IN (/* insert month_number for these days */)
AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = /* insert the desired year */;
```

Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. **FROM and JOINs**:
   - The query joins various tables, ensuring the cities, the respective airports, and the flights are properly matched.

2. **Date Filtering**:
   - The query filters for flights on Wednesday and Thursday, capturing either the last flight on Wednesday using `MAX(DEPARTURE_TIME)` or the first flight on Thursday using `MIN(DEPARTURE_TIME)`.

3. **Date Day and Month**:
   - You need to populate `DAY_NUMBER`, `MONTH_NUMBER`, and the`YEAR` with appropriate values to reflect the specific Wednesday and Thursday you are querying about.

Make sure to replace the placeholder comments with actual values relevant to your database context.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the last flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Wednesday, you would need to filter on the relevant criteria, which includes the specified cities, the day of the week (Wednesday), and sorting by arrival or departure time to find the last flight.

Here's an SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- Replace day_number0 with actual value for Wednesday
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Replace month_number0 with actual value
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace year0 with actual year
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Notes:
1. **Replace Variables**: You will need to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the appropriate values for the date you're querying (specifically for the next upcoming Wednesday).
  
2. **Last Flight**: The `ORDER BY FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC LIMIT 1` clause retrieves only the last flight for the specified criteria by ordering the departure times in descending order.

3. **City Names**: Make sure that "OAKLAND" and "SALT LAKE CITY" match exactly with how they are stored in the `CITY` table (for example, check for any trailing spaces or case sensitivity if necessary).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City for last Wednesday, you will need to query the relevant tables to ensure that you filter for the correct dates and flight details. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND"
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY" 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = last_year 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = last_month 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = last_wednesday_day
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query:
- `last_year`, `last_month`, and `last_wednesday_day` need to be replaced with the actual year, month, and day number for last Wednesday.
- This query links the city, airport, flight, and date information to retrieve the relevant flight records.

Make sure you have the correct values for `last_year`, `last_month`, and `last_wednesday_day` before executing the query.

To retrieve the flight information for a flight from MILWAUKEE to INDIANAPOLIS that departs on Monday before 9:00 AM, the following SQL query can be constructed:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < "09:00:00" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins the necessary airport services and city tables to identify the airports for the origin and destination cities.
- It filters on the specific departure city ("MILWAUKEE") and arrival city ("INDIANAPOLIS").
- It ensures the day of the week is Monday.
- It filters flights whose departure time is before 9:00 AM.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each flight ID is listed uniquely.

Raw LLM Response:
To get flight numbers for flights departing on Thursday before 8:00 AM from Oakland to Salt Lake City, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "Thursday" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < "08:00:00" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:

- The query retrieves distinct flight numbers (`FLIGHT_NUMBER`) for the flight records from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DATE_DAY`, `DAYS`) to filter the flights based on the starting and destination cities (Oakland and Salt Lake City) and the specified day (Thursday).
- The criteria for the departure time is set to be before 8:00 AM.
- Finally, the query ensures the flights actually operate on the specified day (Thursday) by matching the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field.

To list flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City before 6 AM Thursday morning, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < "06:00:00" 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE = "THursday";
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to filter flights from “OAKLAND” to “SALT LAKE CITY”.
- We join the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables to restrict the results to flights that are on a specific Thursday.
- Finally, we ensure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` of the flights is before 6 AM. 

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values representing the date of the upcoming Thursday when you execute this query.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Cincinnati to New York on Saturday before 18:00, you would need to write an SQL query that properly references the relevant tables and fields. The query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0      -- replace with actual day number for Saturday
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- replace with actual month number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0                   -- replace with actual year
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '18:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to link cities to their respective airports.
   - `CITY` provides the city names to ensure the query matches the correct locations.
   - `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` are used to filter for Saturday flights.
   - `FLIGHT` contains the actual flight information, including departure times.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The query specifies `FROM_AIRPORT` as the airport code corresponding to Cincinnati and `TO_AIRPORT` as the airport code corresponding to New York.
   - It also checks that the departure time is before 18:00.

3. **Placeholder Values**:
   - You will need to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values that correspond to this upcoming Saturday's date. 

Make sure that the values for the day, month, and year are calculated based on the current date when executing this query.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for a flight departing from Indianapolis to Cleveland on Tuesday at 12:00 PM, you would first need to account for the appropriate tables in your database schema, specifically the **AIRPORT_SERVICE**, **CITY**, and **FLIGHT** tables. The SQL query should filter for the specified departure city, destination city, day of the week, and departure time.

Here's how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "TUESDAY" 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0       -- Replace with the actual day number needed for Tuesday
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- Replace with the actual month number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0                   -- Replace with the actual year
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = '12:00:00';    -- Ensure the format matches your database's time format
```

### Notes:
- You need to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values for the specific date you're interested in.
- Adjust the time format as necessary to match the structure of `DEPARTURE_TIME` in your database.
- You may include additional columns from the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve more details about the flight.

Raw LLM Response:
To write a SQL query that retrieves flight and fare information for a Thursday departing prior to 9:00 AM from Oakland to Salt Lake City, you can use a query that joins the relevant tables for flights and fares. Here's how you can structure the SQL:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00'
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace `year0` with the actual year value for Thursday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Replace `month_number0` with the actual month value for Thursday
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- Replace `day_number0` with the actual day value if needed
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
```

### Explanation:
- The query retrieves unique flight and fare information.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` tables to access the required data.
- The conditions ensure that the departure airport is Oakland, the arrival airport is Salt Lake City, and the departure time is before 9:00 AM.
- Additionally, you may need to include logic to set the specific date (year, month, and day) related to Thursday. You can replace `year0`, `month_number0`, and `day_number0` with actual values or appropriate logic based on the calendar.

Make sure to adjust the placeholder `year0`, `month_number0`, and `day_number0` according to the specific Thursday you are targeting in your query.

- The conditions ensure that:
  - The departure city is Oakland.
  - The destination city is Salt Lake City.
  - The flight day is Thursday.
  - The flight departs before 8:00 AM.

Question: list CALIFORNIA NEVADA ARIZONA airports
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports located in California, Nevada, and Arizona, we can use the `AIRPORT` table and filter the results based on the `STATE_CODE` for each of those states. Assuming that we know the respective `STATE_CODE` for California (CA), Nevada (NV), and Arizona (AZ), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION 
FROM AIRPORT 
WHERE STATE_CODE IN ('CA', 'NV', 'AZ');
```

In this query:
- We select the `AIRPORT_CODE`, `AIRPORT_NAME`, and `AIRPORT_LOCATION` columns from the `AIRPORT` table.
- We filter the results to include only airports located in California, Nevada, or Arizona by using the `IN` clause with the appropriate `STATE_CODE`.

SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "ARIZONA" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports located in Arizona, the SQL query would use the `AIRPORT` table along with the `STATE` table to filter for airports within the state of Arizona (identified by its state code). Assuming "AZ" is the state code for Arizona, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION 
FROM AIRPORT 
WHERE STATE_CODE = 'AZ';
```

This query retrieves the `AIRPORT_CODE`, `AIRPORT_NAME`, and `AIRPORT_LOCATION` for all airports in Arizona. Make sure to replace 'AZ' with the appropriate state code if it is different in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION

Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports in New York, you would write a SQL query that selects the distinct airport names and codes for the city of New York from the `AIRPORT` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables. Here’s how you can structure that query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_CODE
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

This query joins the `AIRPORT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables to find all airports associated with New York City. It ensures that only distinct airport names and codes are returned.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT.alias0.AIRPORT_CODE
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';

Raw LLM Response:
To find a ticket from NASHVILLE TENNESSEE to SEATTLE, you would typically need to look at the flights available from the relevant airports associated with those cities. Below is an SQL query that achieves this by joining the necessary tables and filtering for the specific cities mentioned:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE TENNESSEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

**Explanation of the SQL query:**
- The query selects distinct fare IDs from the `FARE` table.
- It combines information from `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables.
- It filters for the specific cities "NASHVILLE TENNESSEE" and "SEATTLE" by matching their city codes.
- The conditions ensure that the fare corresponds to flights departing from Nashville to Seattle.

Ensure the database connection and the table schema matches the expected structure to run this SQL query successfully.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Ontario, California to Orlando, you can use the following SQL query. It involves joining the necessary tables to filter the flights based on the departure and destination airports associated with the cities of Ontario, California, and Orlando.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO CALIFORNIA" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- The `FROM` clause selects data from the necessary tables (`AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT`).
- `CITYalias0` and `CITYalias1` represent the cities for Ontario, California, and Orlando, respectively.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the data to ensure that you're selecting flights departing from Ontario and arriving in Orlando based on the airport codes associated with those cities. 

This query will yield the distinct flights available from Ontario, California to Orlando.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from Burbank to Seattle that arrive before 19:00 in Seattle, you would typically utilize a query that filters flights based on departure and arrival information, as well as ensuring that the flights are round trips. Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE "%R%" -- Assuming 'R' indicates round trip days
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '19:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. The query uses the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to identify which airports correspond to Burbank and Seattle via the `CITY` table.
2. It filters based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns in the `FLIGHT` table to match the origins and destinations appropriately.
3. It checks if the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column indicates that it is a round trip by looking for any format that suggests round trip availability (using a placeholder like "%R%").
4. It also ensures that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is before 19:00 (7 PM).
  
### Note:
Ensure that the way round trip flights are identified in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column matches your system's implementation. Adjust the condition accordingly if that's not the case.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cheapest economy flights from Miami to New York, you would need to join the relevant tables including the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find the corresponding airport codes, the `FLIGHT` table for all flights, and the `FARE` table to find the fares associated with these flights. The query will filter for economy class flights and order by the fare to get the cheapest option.

Here's a SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI"
AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"
AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN (
    SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE 
    FROM FARE_BASIS 
    WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = "Economy"
)
ORDER BY FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC;
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **Select Distinct Columns**: `FLIGHT_ID` and fare for one-way flight costs.
- **Join Logic**: Links `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` to get airport codes for Miami and New York, joins `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables to access flight data and fare details.
- **Filter for Economy Class**: In the `WHERE` clause, it ensures that you're only looking for flights associated with the Economy booking class by checking against the `FARE_BASIS` table.
- **Order by Cost**: The results are ordered by `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` in ascending order to get the cheapest flights first. 

This would yield the cheapest economy flights from Miami to New York.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from MILWAUKEE to ATLANTA before 10:00 AM daily, here’s a SQL query that would achieve that using the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FROM` clause joins the necessary tables to relate cities to their corresponding airports and flights.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that we are looking for flights originating from MILWAUKEE (`CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE"`) and heading to ATLANTA (`CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA"`).
- Additionally, it checks that the departure time of the flight is before 10:00 AM. Note that `DEPARTURE_TIME` should ideally be in the format HH:MM:SS.

```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting distinct `FLIGHT_ID` and `FARE_ID`, along with the `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` for fares.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, and `FARE` tables to find relevant data.
- The conditions filter the results to only include flights originating from Toronto (with the appropriate airport) and arriving in St. Petersburg (with the appropriate airport).
- The subquery checks for entries in the `FLIGHT_STOP` table where the `STOP_NUMBER` is greater than 0, which indicates that there are stops. We exclude these flights from our final selection to ensure that only nonstop flights are returned. 

Make sure to adapt the query as needed based on your actual requirements or any additional filters you might want to apply!

Raw LLM Response:
To show weekday flights from MILWAUKEE to ORLANDO that are one-way, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves the distinct flight IDs for flights where the departure is from Milwaukee to Orlando on weekdays only (Monday to Friday).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday') 
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO";  -- Ensure we are looking at one-way flights
```

This query works as follows:

1. It joins the necessary tables to get the connections between cities, airports, and flights.
2. It filters the results based on the specified cities (MILWAUKEE and ORLANDO).
3. It checks if the flight days correspond to the weekdays.
4. It ensures that only one-way flights are considered by filtering on the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field (assuming the `FARE` table is included for one-way fare checks).

Make sure to adapt and run this SQL query appropriately within your database system to retrieve the required results!

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table, using aliases for tables involved in the joins.
- It ensures that the departure city is Milwaukee and the destination is Orlando based on the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables.
- It checks that the flight's days of operation, as represented by `FLIGHT_FLIGHT_DAYS`, match the codes found in the `DAYS` table.
- Finally, it filters out any flights that operate on weekends by excluding 'Saturday' and 'Sunday', focusing only on weekdays.

Question: list LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list information related to LOS ANGELES, you likely want to retrieve data from the `CITY` table, as this table contains the details of cities, including their names and associated codes. Here's a basic SQL query that retrieves the relevant information for LOS ANGELES:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

This query will return all columns from the `CITY` table for the specified city, allowing you to see details like its city code, state code, country name, and time zone code. If you want more specific information, you can modify the SELECT clause to list only the desired columns, such as:

```sql
SELECT CITY_CODE, STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME, TIME_ZONE_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
``` 

Feel free to specify if you meant something else or needed additional details!

Question: list LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all relevant information about Los Angeles from the provided database schema, you would likely be querying the `CITY` table, since that table contains city-related information. Here’s a simple SQL query to retrieve the details for Los Angeles:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES";
```

This query selects all fields from the `CITY` table where the city name matches "LOS ANGELES". If you are interested in specific fields (like the state code or country name), you can modify the `SELECT` statement accordingly, such as:

```sql
SELECT STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES";
``` 

If you want more related information (like airport services or other attributes), you might need joins with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table or other relevant tables depending on your requirements. For example, to join with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get airport codes for Los Angeles, you might use:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE 
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES";
``` 

Adjust your query based on the specific data you need.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from LGA (LaGuardia Airport) to BURBANK (Bob Hope Airport), you can use the following SQL query based on the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = "LGA" 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = "BURBANK" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the distinct flight IDs that match the specified departure and destination airports.
- The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is used to correlate cities with their respective airport codes.
- The query checks both origin (LGA) and destination (BURBANK) airports to retrieve the relevant flight data. 

Make sure to adjust the actual airport codes for LGA and BURBANK if they differ in the database.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS with fares on Monday, you need to join the relevant tables, including the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `DATE_DAY` tables. The SQL query will include conditions to filter for flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS and ensure that the flight is scheduled for Monday.

Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.FARE_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (SELECT FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE WHERE FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID);
```

### Explanation of the Query
1. **Selection**: We are selecting distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID`) and fare IDs (`FAREalias0.FARE_ID`).
2. **Joins**: The query joins multiple tables to correlate the necessary data:
   - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` links to the `CITY` table for both departure (`INDIANAPOLIS`) and destination (`MEMPHIS`).
   - `FLIGHT` connects to the respective `AIRPORT_SERVICE` entries.
   - `FARE` provides price information for the flights.
3. **Conditions**: 
   - The departure city is filtered to "INDIANAPOLIS".
   - The arrival city is filtered to "MEMPHIS".
   - The flights are filtered for those that operate on Monday by checking against the `DAYS` table.
   
This query should return the flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS available on Mondays along with their corresponding fares.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights and fares for a trip from MIAMI to CLEVELAND on a Wednesday, you would want to join the relevant tables, including AIRPORT_SERVICE to get the airport codes, FLIGHT for the flight details, and FARE for the fare information. Generally, a query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "WEDNESDAY"
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 -- Replace with actual day number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 -- Replace with actual month number
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 -- Replace with actual year
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID
  AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement collects all unique flights and fares from Miami to Cleveland.
- `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to match cities to their corresponding airports.
- `CITY` is used to filter for the specified origin (Miami) and destination (Cleveland).
- `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` are utilized to ensure that the flights occur on a Wednesday.
- The query incorporates both flight details (`FLIGHT`) and fare information (`FARE`), joining them through `FLIGHT_FARE`.

### Note:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values corresponding to the Wednesday of interest.
- Depending on the specific requirements, you might want to adjust the queried fare attributes, such as `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST`.

Question: list flights from CHARLOTTE on saturday afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from CHARLOTTE on Saturday afternoon, you'd want to focus on flights departing from the relevant airport and filter the available flights based on the day of the week, in this case, Saturday. You may also want to specify the timing for the afternoon.

Here's an example SQL query that captures this requirement:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "Saturday" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This selects unique flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
2. **FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, DATE_DAY, DAYS, FLIGHT**: You're joining multiple tables to filter out the necessary data.
3. **CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE**: This links the airport service to the appropriate city.
4. **CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"**: Filters for flights from CHARLOTTE.
5. **FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE**: Ensures the flight is leaving from the CHARLOTTE airport.
6. **DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = "Saturday"**: Specifies the day of the week.
7. **FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59'**: Filters for flights during the afternoon, assuming '12:00:00' as the beginning of afternoon and '17:59:59' as the end.
8. **FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE**: Ensures the days of the week match up with the flight schedule.

Make sure to adjust the time filter according to your requirement and ensure the time format matches your database's configuration.

Question: list type of aircraft for all flights from CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.BASIC_TYPE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE IN ( SELECT EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the types of aircraft for all flights from Charlotte, you would generally perform a query that joins the relevant table(s) to retrieve the aircraft type (or any other relevant details about the aircraft) associated with flights departing from Charlotte. Here's how the SQL query can be structured based on your database schema:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFT ON AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE";
```

### Explanation:
- The query starts by selecting distinct aircraft descriptions along with flight IDs and flight numbers for flights originating from Charlotte.
- Joins are made between the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table (to get the airport code for Charlotte), the `CITY` table (to verify the city name), and the `FLIGHT` table (to get flight details).
- An additional join to the `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` table is required to link the aircraft code for the flights.
- Finally, it joins to the `AIRCRAFT` table to fetch the description of the aircraft.

Make sure to replace the column names and tables if necessary, depending on the exact structure of your database.

JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from ORLANDO to TACOMA on Saturday with a fare basis code of 'Q', the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "Saturday"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (SELECT FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID 
                                       FROM FLIGHT_FARE 
                                       JOIN FARE ON FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID 
                                       WHERE FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "Q");
```

This query does the following:

1. Joins the necessary tables to find the routes from "ORLANDO" to "TACOMA".
2. Filters the results to ensure the flight is on a Saturday.
3. Checks that the flight's fare basis code is "Q" by doing a subquery on the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the `FLIGHT_ID` associated with the fare code "Q".

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain a list of seating capacities for Delta Airlines (identified by its airline code, typically "DL") flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City, we can leverage the existing entities in the database schema provided. Here’s how the corresponding SQL query can be formed:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.CAPACITY
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS1
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS2 ON AS1.CITY_CODE = AS2.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS C1 ON AS1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE AND C1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE"
JOIN CITY AS C2 ON AS2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE AND C2.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
JOIN FLIGHT AS F ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AS1.AIRPORT_CODE AND F.TO_AIRPORT = AS2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS ES ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS A ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE F.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL";
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
- **Tables Involved**: We are joining `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the airport codes for the starting city (Seattle) and the destination city (Salt Lake City). 
- **City Filters**: The cities are filtered using their names to ensure we are getting the correct airport services.
- **Flight Information**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined to relate the airports to the specific flights.
- **Aircraft Capacity**: The `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` and `AIRCRAFT` tables are joined to retrieve information about each flight's aircraft and their respective seating capacities.
- **Delta Airlines Filter**: The `WHERE` clause filters flights specifically for Delta Airlines by its airline code ("DL").

This will give you distinct seating capacities for all Delta flights available from Seattle to Salt Lake City.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT A.CAPACITY
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS1
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AS2 ON AS1.CITY_CODE = AS2.CITY_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To list Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City along with the aircraft type, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the necessary tables to get the FLIGHT_ID, AIRLINE_CODE, FROM_AIRPORT, TO_AIRPORT, and the corresponding AIRCRAFT_CODE and AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION.

Here’s the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT, 
    AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE, 
    AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE') 
    AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY')
    AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query
- **FROM and JOIN statements**: The query starts from the `FLIGHT` table and joins it with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get flight details for both the departure (Seattle) and the arrival (Salt Lake City).
- **EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE**: This table is joined to link the flight to its corresponding aircraft.
- **AIRCRAFT**: Finally, it retrieves the aircraft details, including the code and description.
- **WHERE clause**: It filters for flights departing from Seattle to Salt Lake City and ensures they are from Delta Airlines (DL).

### Note
The subqueries in the WHERE clause retrieve the `CITY_CODE` for Seattle and Salt Lake City to ensure matching records from the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table. Adjust the query as needed to fit your exact schema or data requirements.

```

**Note:** To ensure the query is fully functional, replace `[day_number_for_wednesday]`, `[month_number_for_wednesday]`, and `[year_for_next_wednesday]` with the specific day, month, and year values corresponding to "next Wednesday". You might need to calculate these values based on the current date to get the correct details for the query. 

You may also need to include the `FARE` and `FLIGHT_FARE` table in order to verify if the flights have a round trip fare requirement.

Raw LLM Response:
To obtain the fares for round trip flights from CLEVELAND to MIAMI next Wednesday, you would need to write a SQL query that involves several joins among the relevant tables. Below is a structured SQL query for this purpose:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID, FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = <day_number_for_next_wednesday> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = <month_number_for_next_wednesday> 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = <year_for_next_wednesday> 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Conditions**: We are joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `FARE`, `DATE_DAY`, and `DAYS` tables to connect the relevant data points.
  
2. **City Conditions**: Filter the results for flights from CLEVELAND to MIAMI.

3. **Date Conditions**: You need to input the correct `DAY_NUMBER`, `MONTH_NUMBER`, and `YEAR` for next Wednesday.

4. **Round Trip Condition**: The query filters for fares that are marked as round trip required.

Make sure to replace `<day_number_for_next_wednesday>`, `<month_number_for_next_wednesday>`, and `<year_for_next_wednesday>` with the appropriate values based on the current date you are in.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from MIAMI to CLEVELAND for next Sunday, you'll need to select from the `FARE` table while joining with the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find the respective airport codes for MIAMI and CLEVELAND, and you will also need to filter for next Sunday's date. 

Here's an SQL query that captures this information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = [next_day_number] 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = [next_month_number] 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = [next_year] 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

In this query, you will need to replace `[next_day_number]`, `[next_month_number]`, and `[next_year]` with the appropriate values for next Sunday based on your current date. 

Here's how you might calculate next Sunday’s date in pseudo-code:

1. Get today's date.
2. Calculate the number of days until the next Sunday (e.g., if today is Saturday, you would add 1 day).
3. Substitute this calculated date into your SQL query.

This will give you the direct fares available from MIAMI to CLEVELAND for next Sunday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights departing early Saturday morning from Chicago to Seattle that are nonstop and include meal services, you can use the following SQL query. The query will join relevant tables to ensure it captures the required information, including the flight details and meal service:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '12:00:00' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%SATURDAY%' 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table, ensuring that the flights are nonstop (indicated by `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0`).
- It filters flights based on the departure city ("CHICAGO") and arrival city ("SEATTLE").
- The departure time is set to be between midnight and noon (`'00:00:00'` to `'12:00:00'`) to capture early morning flights.
- The flight must operate on Saturday (`FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%SATURDAY%'`).
- Finally, it ensures that the flight includes meal service by checking that the `MEAL_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table matches that in the `FOOD_SERVICE` table.

Adjust the time frame in the `BETWEEN` clause as necessary to meet the specific definition of "early morning" if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Chicago to Seattle on Saturday morning that provide meal services, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'; -- Assuming Saturday morning is before noon
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins multiple tables:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` is used to get airport codes based on city names.
  - `CITY` is filtered to match "CHICAGO" and "SEATTLE".
  - `FLIGHT` provides flight details, ensuring it matches the originating and destination airport codes.
  - `DAYS` ensures that the flights are available on "SATURDAY".
  - `FOOD_SERVICE` checks if the selected flights have meals associated with them based on `MEAL_CODE`.
- The `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition restricts results to flights in the morning hours (between 6 AM and 12 PM). Adjust these times if you need to refine the morning period further.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Saturday morning flights with meals from Chicago to Minneapolis, you'd need to join the relevant tables and ensure the specified criteria for flights, meals, and days are applied. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MINNEAPOLIS"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00' -- Assuming morning means from 6 AM to 12 PM
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE; -- Assuming there is a meal associated with the flight
```

### Explanation
- **Table Joins**: The query joins several tables:
  - `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to connect cities with their respective airports.
  - `CITY` to specify origins and destinations.
  - `FLIGHT` to pull the actual flight information.
  - `FOOD_SERVICE` to fetch meal details for each flight.
  - `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` to filter for Saturday flights.

- **WHERE Clauses**: Conditions specify:
  - The cities being queried (Chicago and Minneapolis).
  - The time range indicating morning flights (between `06:00:00` and `12:00:00`).
  - The day of the week (Saturday).
  - Ensuring that the flight has a meal option by checking the `MEAL_CODE`.

Make sure to adjust the time and any other constants in the SQL query as per your database's time format or requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from SEATTLE to CHICAGO that have meals provided by Continental Airlines (CO), we need to reference the appropriate tables for flights, meals, and airport services. We'll join the required tables to find the matching flights based on the specified criteria.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE 
  AND FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPONENT = "CO";  -- Adjust the component field as necessary for meals from CO
```

### Explanation:
- We select distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find the airport codes for SEATTLE and CHICAGO.
- We also join the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to filter for flights that include meals provided by Continental Airlines (CO).
- Adjust the condition in the WHERE clause that references the meal (possibly the `COMPARTMENT` or another relevant field) based on your data schema, ensuring it only includes meals from CO.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cheapest round trip flights from Indianapolis to Orlando around December 25, you can use the following SQL query. This query considers both the fare for the round trip flight and the airport services associated with the cities.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO"
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "YES"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN (
      SELECT FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID

      WHERE FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID
  )
ORDER BY FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;    -- Limiting to the cheapest flight
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the distinct flight IDs and round trip costs from multiple tables, linking them based on the respective city and airport services.
- The conditions filter for flights departing from Indianapolis to Orlando.
- The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is checked to ensure that only round trip tickets are considered.
- The results are ordered by the `ROUND_TRIP_COST` in ascending order, and you can limit the results to just get the cheapest round trip flight using `LIMIT 1`.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest one-way fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 27th, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables to filter one-way fares and applies a sorting mechanism to find the cheapest fare for the specified date:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Cheapest_OneWay_Fare 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 27 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0   -- Replace year0 with the relevant year
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO";
```

### Explanation:
- **Table Joins**: The query joins multiple tables to link cities, airport services, fares, dates, and flight information.
- **City Filtering**: Filters based on the specific cities "INDIANAPOLIS" and "ORLANDO".
- **Date Filtering**: Specifies that the date should be December 27th.
- **One-Way Fare**: Focuses on one-way fares by checking that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` equals "NO".
- **Minimum Cost**: Uses `MIN` to find the cheapest fare from the possible options.

### Note:
- You'll need to substitute `year0` with the actual year for the date you wish to query.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from both NEW YORK to LAS VEGAS and MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS on Sunday, you'll want to join the relevant tables and filter for flights on the specified day. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,

     CITY AS CITYalias2,
     CITY AS CITYalias3,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"
       AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS"
       AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT)
   OR (CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE

   AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
   AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
   AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SUNDAY";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joins**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` records to identify the airport codes for both cities in each segment of the trip.
2. **City Conditions**: It checks for flights from "NEW YORK" to "LAS VEGAS" and from "MEMPHIS" to "LAS VEGAS".
3. **Date Conditions**: It filters on the defined day (e.g., Sunday) to ensure that the flights are on that particular day of the week.
4. **Distinct Flights**: It returns distinct flight IDs to avoid duplicates if multiple flights match the criteria.

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual numbers that correspond to the upcoming Sunday.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve available flights from both NEW YORK to LAS VEGAS and MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS on a Sunday, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS"
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias2 ON CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS"
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
AND (FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE OR FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE)
JOIN DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 ON DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME
JOIN DAYS AS DAYSalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE
WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY'; 
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Join Tables**: The query joins the necessary tables to link the flight details with the respective cities.
2. **City Matches**: It checks for flights from "NEW YORK" to "LAS VEGAS" and also accommodates flights from "MEMPHIS" to "LAS VEGAS".
3. **Sunday Check**: It filters down to only include flights that are on Sundays.
4. **Select Distinct**: It ensures that the flight IDs returned are distinct, avoiding duplicates.

Make sure to replace any placeholder values or adapt according to your database's actual column names or configurations as necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh on a Tuesday afternoon, you can create a SQL query that uses the relevant tables and conditions. Below is an example of how such a query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- replace day_number0 with the actual day number for Tuesday
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- replace month_number0 with the actual month number
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- replace year0 with the actual year
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59';  -- Assumes afternoon is from 12 PM to 5:59 PM
```

Be sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the proper values for the specific Tuesday you are querying about. The time range for the afternoon flights is set between noon (12:00) and 5:59 PM. Adjust these times as necessary based on specific definitions or requirements you may have.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh in the afternoon on a Monday, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0  -- Specify the day number for the upcoming Monday
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0  -- Specify the month number
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0  -- Specify the current year
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME

      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59';  -- Assuming afternoon is defined as 12 PM to 5:59 PM
```

### Key Points:
- Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with appropriate values for the upcoming Monday.
- This query checks for flights departing between noon and just before 6 PM on that Monday.
- Ensure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field is formatted correctly in your database for this time comparison to work.

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves flights from Baltimore to San Francisco, arriving between 17:00 and 20:00, you'll need to filter the results based on the specified departure and arrival criteria. Below is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:00' AND '20:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query begins by selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT` tables to find relevant data.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights based on:
  - The origin being Baltimore (`CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE"`).
  - The destination being San Francisco (`CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO"`).
  - The `ARRIVAL_TIME` of flights falling between 17:00 (5 PM) and 20:00 (8 PM).

Question: how many NW flights leave WASHINGTON DC
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the number of Northwest (NW) flights leaving Washington, DC, you'll need to filter by both the airline code for Northwest (which is likely "NW") and the airports servicing Washington, DC. The SQL query will join the relevant tables, counting the flights from the airport(s) servicing Washington, DC.

Here is an appropriate SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS NumberOfFlights
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" 
AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW";
```

This query does the following:
- Counts the distinct `FLIGHT_ID`s from the `FLIGHT` table.
- Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to get corresponding airports for Washington, DC.
- Ensures we're only selecting flights where the `AIRLINE_CODE` equals "NW", which is the code for Northwest Airlines.
- Filters city names to only include "WASHINGTON".
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS NumberOfFlights
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

Raw LLM Response:
To find out how many flights Northwest Airlines (often abbreviated as NW) has leaving from Washington D.C.'s Dulles International Airport (IAD), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW"
AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = "IAD"
);
```

This query counts the distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table for flights where the airline code is "NW" (indicating Northwest Airlines) and where the departure airport is Dulles International Airport (IAD).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID) AS FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW"
AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = "IAD"
);

Raw LLM Response:
To find a connecting flight from Dallas to San Francisco that leaves after 4:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This will consider the appropriate airports in Dallas and San Francisco, look for flights that depart after 4:00 AM, and account for connections (which are typically indicated by the presence of multiple flight legs):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '04:00:00';
```

This query does the following:

1. Selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. Joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table twice to determine the airport codes for Dallas and San Francisco using their respective city names.
3. Filters flights where the departure time is greater than 4:00 AM, ensuring it finds flights that leave after that time. 
4. You may need to add connections based on the structure of your database if you want to specifically identify connecting flights by including details from the `FLIGHT_STOP` or `FLIGHT_LEG` tables if those are relevant. 

If you want to specifically include connecting flights, you may have to join with the `FLIGHT_LEG` table. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Raw LLM Response:
To query for FIRST class and COACH flights between JFK and ORLANDO, you need to filter the flights based on the corresponding booking classes. Assuming that FIRST class is represented by a certain booking class (let's say "F" for first class) and COACH by another class (let's say "Y" for coach), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK"       -- JFK is in New York
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
      AND (FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "F" OR FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "Y");
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. It joins the relevant tables to connect airports and flights, filtering out flights departing from JFK (New York) to Orlando.
3. It emphasizes that only fares associated with the FIRST class (assuming "F") and COACH class (assuming "Y") are included by checking the `BOOKING_CLASS` in the `FARE_BASIS` table. 
4. Adjust the `BOOKING_CLASS` values based on your specific definitions for FIRST and COACH if they differ.

Make sure to modify the booking class identifiers if your schema uses different codes for each class.

Raw LLM Response:
Here is the SQL query that will retrieve the FIRST class and COACH flights from JFK airport to MIAMI:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     FARE AS FAREalias0,
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI"

  AND (FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST" OR FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "COACH")
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects distinct flight IDs (`FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID`) from the `FLIGHT` table where the departure city is "NEW YORK" (corresponding to JFK airport) and the destination city is "MIAMI".
- It also joins the `FARE` table to filter the fares by booking class, specifically looking for those that are either "FIRST" or "COACH".
- The necessary conditions and relationships between the relevant tables (such as `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, and `FARE_BASIS`) are included to ensure that the results are accurate based on the specified needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve both FIRST class and COACH flights from JFK to MIAMI, you can modify the SQL query to join the necessary tables and include conditions to filter by the booking classes corresponding to FIRST class and COACH. Here’s an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FARE AS FAREalias0, 
     FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
      AND (FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "FIRST" OR FARE_BASISalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "COACH");
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The query joins the necessary tables to retrieve flight information between the specified cities (NEW YORK and MIAMI).
2. **City Code**: It filters based on the city names for NEW YORK and MIAMI.
3. **Flight Conditions**: It specifies which airport each flight is departing from and arriving at.
4. **Fare Conditions**: It checks that the fare corresponds to either FIRST class or COACH by filtering the booking classes in the `FARE_BASIS` table.

Question: are meals ever served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if meals are ever served on 'FF', you can query the `FLIGHT` and `FOOD_SERVICE` tables by checking if any flights have a `MEAL_CODE` corresponding to 'FF'. Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE 
WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE = 'FF';
```

In this query, we are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table where there is a join with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table on the `MEAL_CODE`. We filter for any meals with the code 'FF'. If the result set contains any rows, then meals are indeed served on flights with that meal code.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE 
WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE = 'FF';

Question: are snacks served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) AND FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_DESCRIPTION = "SNACK" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine whether snacks are served on a specific flight (identified by flight code "FF"), the information about meal service needs to be looked up. Unfortunately, snacks or meal service details aren't directly part of the provided database schema. However, we can look for the required details typically involving the `FLIGHT` and `FOOD_SERVICE` tables.

Assuming that "FF" refers to a flight number, the query can look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_DESCRIPTION 
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
    FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 
WHERE 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'FF' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE;
```

This SQL query checks the `FLIGHT` table for the flight number "FF" and retrieves the associated meal descriptions from the `FOOD_SERVICE` table. If snacks are included in the meal descriptions returned, then it can be inferred that snacks are served on that flight. 

Make sure that the `MEAL_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table corresponds to the correct meal service from the `FOOD_SERVICE` table for the specific flight in question.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_DESCRIPTION 
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
    FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 
WHERE 
    FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'FF' 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE;

Raw LLM Response:
To list the cheapest fare from CHARLOTTE to LAS VEGAS, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS CHEAPEST_FARE
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE'
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
      AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'NO';
```

### Explanation:
1. The `MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST)` function is used to get the cheapest fare among the available one-way fares.
2. The query follows the same structure as previous queries, joining the necessary tables to filter for flights from CHARLOTTE to LAS VEGAS.
3. It checks for non-round trip fares by including the condition `FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'NO'`. 

Make sure you adjust the column and table names if your schema differs. If you also want to see additional details (like fare ID), you can modify the SELECT clause accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the lowest fares from WASHINGTON to SALT LAKE CITY, you can use a SQL query that joins relevant tables (such as AIRPORT_SERVICE and FARE) to find the lowest fare available for flights between the two cities. Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Lowest_Fare
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FARE AS FAREalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
  AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation:
- The `MIN()` function is used to get the lowest fare from the available records.
- The query joins the AIRPORT_SERVICE table to identify the airport codes for both cities (WASHINGTON and SALT LAKE CITY).
- It then references the FARE table to find the fares associated with those airport codes.
- The result will provide the lowest fare for a one-way trip from WASHINGTON to SALT LAKE CITY.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the lowest fare from BWI to Salt Lake City, you can write an SQL query that joins the `FARE`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables to find the relevant fare information. Here's an example of how you could structure the query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FARE.FARE_ID) AS Lowest_Fare 
FROM FARE AS FAREalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'BWI'
AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

This query seeks to find the minimum fare for flights originating from Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) to Salt Lake City by joining relevant tables based on city names and airport codes. Adjust the selection of columns or conditions as necessary based on your specific requirements.

Question: list all flights leaving DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= departure_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights leaving Denver between 2000 and 2100, you can use the following SQL query. This will filter flights based on the departure time and ensure the FROM_AIRPORT matches Denver's airport code (you'll need to replace "DEN" with the appropriate airport code for Denver if it's different):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "DEN" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '20:00' AND '21:00';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table to filter flights that are leaving specifically from Denver.
- We are looking for flights with a departure time between 2000 and 2100 (8:00 PM and 9:00 PM). Make sure to use the correct time format as per your database requirements.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "DEN" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '20:00' AND '21:00';

Question: what airlines serve DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out which airlines serve Denver, you can write an SQL query that joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline information associated with the airport code for Denver. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 ON AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

In this SQL:
1. We are selecting distinct airline names.
2. We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for the airport code corresponding to Denver.
3. We join the `AIRLINE` table to get the names of the airlines serving that airport.
4. The `WHERE` clause specifies that we are only interested in Denver's airport. 

Make sure to replace `'DENVER'` in the `WHERE` clause appropriately if you're using a different identification for Denver in your `AIRPORT` table. If you have a specific airport code for Denver, you might want to use that instead in an `AIRPORT_CODE` condition.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine which airlines fly into Denver, you can join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table with the `AIRLINE` table based on the airport code. Here's an SQL query that retrieves the airlines that operate flights into Denver:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias ON FLIGHTalias.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHTalias.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORTalias.AIRPORT_NAME = "DENVER";
```

In this query:
- We are selecting distinct airlines (both code and name) that fly to the airport identified as "DENVER".
- The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table connects airport operations with specific flights.
- The `FLIGHT` table is used here to determine which flights arrive at Denver, and then we obtain the corresponding airlines.

Question: list all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all of the daily flights arriving in Denver between 2000 and 2100, you'll need to select distinct flight IDs that meet the criteria. The SQL query will also involve filtering based on the arrival time within the specified range and checking the flight days to ensure they are marked as daily. Here's how you can construct that SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
                                   FROM AIRPORT 
                                   WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER') 
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = 'DAILY';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0**: We're selecting from the `FLIGHT` table with an alias for easier reference.
2. **TO_AIRPORT**: We're ensuring that the flight is arriving at Denver. We assume "DENVER" matches an airport in the `AIRPORT` table.
3. **ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100'**: We're filtering for flights arriving between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM.
4. **FLIGHT_DAYS = 'DAILY'**: We check that the flights are labeled as daily flights.
5. **DISTINCT FLIGHT_ID**: We make sure to return only unique flight IDs.

Adjust the subquery for `TO_AIRPORT` based on how the airport code is stored (you may want to use `AIRPORT_CODE` directly if you already know it).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
                                   FROM AIRPORT 
                                   WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER') 
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000' AND '2100' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = 'DAILY';

Question: list all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER from 2000 to 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100, you would need to filter the flights based on the arrival time and check if they arrive at DENVER. The following SQL query accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN (
    SELECT CITY.CITY_CODE 
    FROM CITY 
    WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER'
) 
AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%D%';  -- Assuming 'D' represents daily flights in the FLIGHT_DAYS column
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHTalias0`: Alias for the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flight information.
- `AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1`: Alias for `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to filter based on destination airport (in this case, DENVER).
- The subquery fetches the `CITY_CODE` for DENVER from the `CITY` table.
- We check if the `ARRIVAL_TIME` of the flight is between 2000 and 2100 (inclusive).
- Assuming that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field has a format where "D" indicates daily flights, we filter for those flights as well. Adjust this part as needed based on the actual content of the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100 hours, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE 
WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" 
AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '20:00' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '21:00' 
AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%D%';  -- Assume 'D' represents daily flights in FLIGHT_DAYS
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: This selects distinct flight IDs from the FLIGHT table.
2. **FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0**: Initiates the query from the FLIGHT table.
3. **JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1**: Joins the FLIGHT table with AIRPORT_SERVICE to find services to the desired location.
4. **JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1**: Joins with the CITY table to filter for flights arriving in Denver.
5. **WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER"**: Filters results to only include flights arriving in Denver.
6. **AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '20:00' AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '21:00'**: Limits the results to those arriving between 2000 and 2100 hours.
7. **AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%D%'**: Assumes that 'D' denotes flights that operate daily.

Make sure to adjust the interpretation of `FLIGHT_DAYS` depending on the exact representation in your database schema. If daily flights are coded differently, update the condition accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights arriving or leaving Denver (DEN) between 20:00 (8 PM) and 21:00 (9 PM), you would use a SQL query that selects from the `FLIGHT` table, checking for departure and arrival times and using the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to ensure you're focusing on Denver. The SQL query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE (FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '20:00:00' AND '21:00:00')
   OR (FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '20:00:00' AND '21:00:00');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Distinct Flight IDs**: We want the unique IDs for the flights so we use `DISTINCT`.
2. **Filtering for Flights from and to Denver**:
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` condition checks if flights are leaving from Denver (`DEN`).
   - The `TO_AIRPORT` condition checks if flights are arriving in Denver.
3. **Time Conditions**: 
   - We check if the departure or arrival time falls between `20:00:00` and `21:00:00`. 

### Notes:
- This query assumes that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` are stored in the `HH:MM:SS` format in the database.
- Adjust the format based on how your database stores times, if necessary.

   OR (FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '20:00:00' AND '21:00:00');

SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To check for ground transportation from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) into New York City, you can query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, joining it with the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to ensure you are looking specifically for services that operate between LGA and New York City. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, CITY AS CITYalias0
WHERE GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA"
AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK";
```

This query will return distinct transportation options (`TRANSPORT_TYPE`) along with their fares (`GROUND_FARE`) available from LaGuardia Airport into New York City.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0, AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0, CITY AS CITYalias0

AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA"
AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE

Question: please list the ground transportation from LGA into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the ground transportation options from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) into New York City, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND CITY.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

This query selects distinct types of ground transportation and their associated fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table where the airport code corresponds to LGA and the city is New York. It ensures you get relevant transportation options provided by the ground services linked to that specific airport.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND CITY.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';

Question: please list ground transportation from EWR into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list ground transportation from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) into New York, you need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table by specifying the airport code for EWR and the city code for New York. Below is the SQL query that would achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 
JOIN AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "EWR" 
AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK";
```

This query selects the transport types and their respective fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, linking it to the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to filter for ground transportation services specifically going from EWR into New York.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the nonstop flights from Cincinnati to Charlotte that are leaving after 12:00 PM and arriving before 7:00 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '12:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '19:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to ensure that we are looking at flights departing from Cincinnati and arriving in Charlotte.
- The condition `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` ensures that only nonstop flights are retrieved.
- The `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` filters are used to check that the flight leaves after 12:00 PM and arrives before 7:00 PM.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight on Tuesday from San Diego to Indianapolis that departs in the afternoon, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM and JOINs**: The query starts by selecting from multiple tables (AIRPORT_SERVICE, CITY, DATE_DAY, DAYS, and FLIGHT) to gather information about the flights.
- **City Conditions**: It matches San Diego for departure (from CITY table) and Indianapolis for arrival.
- **Date and Day Conditions**: It filters the flights to only those that are scheduled for a specific Tuesday (the exact date would need to be filled in by the user).
- **Departure Time**: The condition `AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00'` restricts the results to afternoon flights. Adjust the time as necessary based on what "afternoon" means (e.g., some may consider it to be from 12 PM to 5 PM, etc.).

Make sure to replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual values corresponding to the next Tuesday's date for the query to return specific flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the type of aircraft used for the American Airlines (AA) flight leaving at 16:19, you would need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` table and the `AIRCRAFT` table based on the aircraft code sequence. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, AIRCRAFT.MANUFACTURER, AIRCRAFT.BASIC_TYPE
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFT ON EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" 
AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = "16:19";
```

This query selects the description, manufacturer, and basic type of the aircraft used for the specified flight from American Airlines (AA) departing at 16:19. It joins the relevant tables to obtain the necessary information about the aircraft associated with that flight.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Charlotte, North Carolina to Phoenix, Arizona on Monday, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE (CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" 
       AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
       AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" 
       AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT 
       AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
       AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'Monday');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**: The query joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to gather necessary information about the flights.
2. **City Conditions**: It checks for the cities: `CHARLOTTE` for the departure and `PHOENIX` for the arrival.
3. **Flight Day Condition**: The query specifically looks for flights that are scheduled on `Monday`.
4. **Selecting Distinct Flight IDs**: To avoid duplicates, `DISTINCT` is used on `FLIGHT_ID`.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from St. Paul, Minnesota to St. Louis on a Thursday, you would need to join various tables and filter on the appropriate conditions for the departure city, arrival city, day of the week, and relevant flight information. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "THURSDAY";
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joins**: The query joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT` tables to get the necessary information about the flights.
2. **Conditions**:
   - It filters for flights departing from "ST. PAUL" and arriving at "ST. LOUIS".
   - It checks that the flight day matches "THURSDAY".
3. **Selection**: Finally, it selects the distinct `FLIGHT_ID` from the results.

This query will return all available flight IDs for flights from St. Paul to St. Louis on Thursdays.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from St. Louis to Charlotte, North Carolina, departing on a Friday, you can construct the SQL query as follows. This query assumes you have access to the necessary city and airport services to fetch the relevant airport codes:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS"
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "FRIDAY"
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE;
```

### Explanation of Query Components:

- **FROM Clause**: Joins multiple tables to fetch the required information (airports, cities, days, flights).
- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - Filters for flights departing from "ST. LOUIS" to "CHARLOTTE".
  - Ensures the departure day is a "FRIDAY".
- **DISTINCT**: Ensures that results for the same flight (if any) are not repeated in the results. 

This SQL query will return all the unique flight IDs that match the specified criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query that finds flights from SALT LAKE CITY to EWR airport that arrive on Saturday before 18:00, you would follow a similar structure to the previous queries by utilizing relevant tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY`. The SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0,
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE 
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
    AND CITYalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = "EWR"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "Saturday" 
    AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < "18:00:00";
```

**Explanation:**
- The query selects distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to correctly map the airports to their respective cities.
- It adds a condition for the destination to be the EWR airport by specifying the `AIRPORT_CODE`.
- It filters the flights to only include those that arrive on a Saturday before 18:00. 
- Make sure to set the appropriate time format for `ARRIVAL_TIME`.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Cincinnati to EWR airport that arrives on Saturday before 18:00, you would structure your SQL query similarly to the previous examples. You will need to check the CITY names and AIRPORT codes while also filtering the FLIGHT arrival times and the DAY of the week. Below is the SQL query that addresses your request:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI' 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK'  -- Assuming 'EWR' airport is in Newark
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00' 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';  -- Ensure it is Saturday
```

**Notes:**
1. Replace `day_number0`, `month_number0`, and `year0` with the actual date values for the upcoming Saturday you are interested in.
2. It is assumed that the CITY name for EWR is "NEWARK". If the representation in your DATABASE is different, please replace it accordingly.
3. The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is being compared to '18:00:00' to ensure the flight arrives before 6 PM. Adjust the time format as necessary according to how times are stored in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights between Cincinnati and San Jose, California, that leave after 18:00, you would typically want to join the relevant tables to filter for flights based on the departure times and airport services. Here is how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00';
```

**Explanation:**
- This query selects distinct `FLIGHT_ID`s from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It includes the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to determine the airports servicing Cincinnati and San Jose, California.
- It checks that the flight departs from Cincinnati and arrives in San Jose.
- Finally, it filters the results to include only those flights that have a departure time later than 18:00.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,

     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI"
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE"
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: what are the nonstop flights between SAN JOSE and HOUSTON TEXAS
SQL:

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "TEXAS" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights between San Jose and Houston, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table for flights that do not have any stops (that is, where the `STOPS` field is equal to 0) and ensure that the departure and arrival airports correspond to San Jose and Houston, respectively. 

Here’s the SQL query you could use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON TEXAS" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0;
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `CITY` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to find the corresponding airport codes for San Jose and Houston.
- We are filtering on `FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = 0` to ensure we only select nonstop flights.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

To find a flight from Salt Lake City to New York City next Saturday that arrives before 18:00, you need to determine the specific day of the week for next Saturday, retrieve the corresponding `DAY_CODE` for that day, and filter the flights based on the desired conditions. Here’s how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
    AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY"
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
    AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK CITY"
    AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
    AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = <day_number>  -- Replace <day_number> with the actual day number for next Saturday
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = <month_number>  -- Replace <month_number> with the actual month number
    AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = <year>  -- Replace <year> with the actual year
    AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00';
```

### Notes:
1. You will need to calculate the day number, month number, and year for next Saturday based on the current date.
2. Replace `<day_number>`, `<month_number>`, and `<year>` with the specific values that correspond to next Saturday.
3. The `ARRIVAL_TIME` comparison is made to ensure that only flights that arrive before 18:00 are selected.

Make sure you gather the necessary date details for the query to work accurately.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Salt Lake City to New York next Saturday, arriving before 1800, you can formulate the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '23:59:59' 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = [day_number_of_next_saturday] 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = [month_number_of_next_saturday] 
      AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = [year_of_next_saturday] 
      AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00';
```

In this query:

- Replace `[day_number_of_next_saturday]`, `[month_number_of_next_saturday]`, and `[year_of_next_saturday]` with the actual date values of next Saturday.
- We're joining the necessary tables to ensure we filter the flights from Salt Lake City to New York that belong to Delta Airlines (identified by the `AIRLINE_CODE` as "DL").
- We're also checking for the arrival time to be before 1800 (6 PM). 

Make sure to retrieve the correct date for next Saturday in whatever programming/scripting environment you are using!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flight information from Kansas City to Chicago, departing on Wednesday, May 26, and arriving by 7:00 PM, the SQL query would need to filter for flights that meet these specific conditions, including handling both the departure and return legs. 

Assuming you have the exact criteria for the departure time and return information, here’s a possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID, FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0, 
     DAYS AS DAYSalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = 26 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = 5 
  AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 
  AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '19:00:00' 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '19:00:00';
```

### Query Explanation:
- **SELECT DISTINCT**: Selects unique flight IDs from both departure and return flights.
- **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: Includes necessary tables for airports, cities, and flights.
- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - Filters for the departure city (`KANSAS CITY`) and arrival city (`CHICAGO`).
  - Ensures the flight's departure day matches May 26, Wednesday.
  - Sets time constraints for flights departing by 7:00 PM and allows for return flights that take place after 7:00 PM.

You'll need to adjust `year0` in the `WHERE` clause to reflect the intended year you want to specify.

Raw LLM Response:
To find American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark to Nashville around 6:30 PM, you can use a SQL query that leverages the relevant tables in the database schema (`FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY`). Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'NASHVILLE' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '19:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM clause:** This defines the tables involved in the query. The `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table is joined twice to find airports in both source and destination cities.
- **WHERE clause:**
  - The first two conditions check that the current city's name matches 'NEWARK' for the departure and 'NASHVILLE' for the arrival.
  - It checks that the flight departs from the airport for Newark and arrives at the airport for Nashville.
  - It specifies that the airline code must be 'AA' (American Airlines).
  - Finally, it filters for flights departing between 6:00 PM (`18:00:00`) and 7:00 PM (`19:00:00`), which captures those around 6:30 PM.

This query will return all distinct flight IDs for available AA flights from Newark to Nashville around the specified time. Make sure to adjust the time format based on your database's requirements if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip flight from LOS ANGELES to TACOMA WASHINGTON with a stopover in SAN FRANCISCO not exceeding the price of 300 dollars for the date 6/10/1993, you would need to consider several factors in your SQL query, including the details of the flights, the fares, and the stopover requirements.

Here's a potential SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias0 ON CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS CITYalias1 ON CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 ON FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID
JOIN FARE AS FAREalias1 ON FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID = FAREalias1.FARE_ID
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES'
  AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = 'TACOMA'
  AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '1993-06-10 00:00:00' AND '1993-06-10 23:59:59'
  AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'
  AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'))
  AND (FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST + FAREalias1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) <= 300;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID**: Selecting distinct Flight IDs for the resulting flights.
- **JOINs**: The various JOINs are used to connect the flights with their respective source and destination airports, cities, and fare details.
- **WHERE Clause Conditions**:
  - Check if the departure is from LOS ANGELES and arrives at TACOMA.
  - Ensure the departure is on the specified date (June 10, 1993).
  - Ensure the flight is a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'`).
  - The stopover in SAN FRANCISCO is checked via the subquery to get its AIRPORT_CODE.
  - Finally, filter the fare to ensure the total cost (round trip) does not exceed $300.

Make sure to adjust any field names and types as per your database design, and verify the logic aligns with your application needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is one airline that flies from Burbank to Milwaukee, then from Milwaukee to St. Louis, and finally back from St. Louis to Burbank, we can create an SQL query that identifies flights for each leg of the trip and checks if there is a common airline for all three legs. 

Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 ON FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 ON FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "BURBANK") 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE")

INTERSECT

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias1.AIRLINE_CODE 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 ON FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3 ON FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE") 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS")

INTERSECT 

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias2.AIRLINE_CODE 
FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias2
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias4 ON FLIGHTalias2.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias4.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias5 ON FLIGHTalias2.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias5.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias4.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS") 
  AND AIRPORT_SERVICEalias5.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = "BURBANK");
```

### Explanation:

1. The first part of the query selects distinct airlines that operate flights from **Burbank** to **Milwaukee**.
2. The second part of the query selects distinct airlines that have flights from **Milwaukee** to **St. Louis**.
3. The third part selects distinct airlines for routes from **St. Louis** back to **Burbank**.
4. The `INTERSECT` operation ensures that we only return airlines that appear in all three parts, indicating these airlines operate on all three legs of the trip. 

If the result returns any rows, it means there is at least one airline that serves all three routes. If not, there is no single airline that provides service for all required legs of the journey.

Question: i'd like to book two flights to WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To provide a SQL query for booking two flights to Westchester County, we first need to ensure we identify flights that depart from a specific location (you may want to specify the departure city) and then match those flights to the destination airport code for Westchester County.

Assuming the airport code for Westchester County is `HPN`, here is an example SQL query that can be used:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID
FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0,
     AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias1,
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0,
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1,
     CITY AS CITYalias0,
     CITY AS CITYalias1
WHERE
    CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND
    CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "YOUR_DEPARTURE_CITY" AND  -- Substitute with your actual departure city
    AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = "HPN" AND  -- Westchester County Airport code
    FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND
    FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Notes:
1. **Substitutions Needed**: Replace `YOUR_DEPARTURE_CITY` with the actual departure city you want to travel from.
2. **Limitation of Results**: If you specifically want two flights and can identify them with certain criteria (e.g., time, date, airline), you may want to add additional WHERE conditions or use a LIMIT clause.
3. **Booking Logic**: This SQL query only fetches the flights. To make an actual booking, you would typically need to execute an insert statement into a bookings table, which should link or associate the flight IDs with the customer's details.
4. **Fare Information**: Consider fetching fare information alongside if needed for the booking process.

If you need any further details added to capture specific conditions (like time, availability, etc.) or want to specify fare selections, please provide more information.

Raw LLM Response:
Here's the SQL query to find a flight from Cincinnati to any airport in the New York area (assuming there are multiple airports in the New York area like JFK, LGA, and EWR):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID 
FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0, 
     AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1, 
     CITY AS CITYalias0, 
     CITY AS CITYalias1, 
     FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 
WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE 
      AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME IN ("NEW YORK", "JAMAICA", "NEWARK") 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE 
      AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

In this query:
- We're selecting distinct flight IDs from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We're joining the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables to make the connections between airports and their respective cities.
- The cities considered for the New York area include "NEW YORK", "JAMAICA" (the neighborhood where JFK is located), and "NEWARK" (where Newark Liberty International Airport is located).
- This way, you can find any available flights from Cincinnati to the specified airports in the New York area.
