Question: do you have an 819 flight from DENVER to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check if there is a flight with the flight number 819 from Denver to San Francisco in the given database schema, you need to write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables. Specifically, you'll likely reference the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and perhaps `CITY` tables to confirm the airport codes for the respective cities.

Here’s an SQL query to find that information:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.FROM_AIRPORT, f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '819'
  AND a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
  AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

In this query:

- We are selecting flight details from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We are joining the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get details for the departure airport (Denver) and once to get details for the destination airport (San Francisco).
- We filter the results where the `FLIGHT_NUMBER` is '819', and the departure airport's name matches 'DENVER' while the arrival airport's name matches 'SAN FRANCISCO'.

This query will return any matching flights or indicate that none exist based on the criteria.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.FROM_AIRPORT, f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '819'
  AND a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER'
  AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';

Question: i would like a flight from KANSAS CITY to ST. PAUL departing at 1600
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Kansas City to St. Paul departing at 16:00, you'll first need to know the relevant airport codes for both cities. Let's assume the airport codes are as follows:

- Kansas City (MCI) 
- St. Paul (MSP)

With this, you can write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables to retrieve the desired flight information. Here's an example query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. PAUL' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME::time = '16:00:00'::time
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time, along with the names of the airports.
2. **FROM Statement**: Indicates the main table (`FLIGHT`).
3. **JOINs**: Combines the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get both the departure and arrival airport names.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights from Kansas City to St. Paul that depart at 16:00.
5. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results by departure time.

Make sure to adjust any airport codes or names according to your actual database values if they differ from the assumptions.

Question: do you have a flight leaving BOSTON at 645 going to WASHINGTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight leaving from BOSTON to WASHINGTON at 6:45, you can use the following SQL query. This example assumes that the airport codes for BOSTON and WASHINGTON are known. The query will join the `FLIGHT` and `AIRPORT` tables to filter for flights that meet your criteria.

Assuming BOSTON's airport code is "BOS" and WASHINGTON's airport code is "DCA", the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
       AP1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
       AP2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT AP1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AP1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
  AND AP2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME = '06:45';
```

Make sure to replace 'BOSTON' and 'WASHINGTON' with the actual airport names if you're using a different naming convention. Also, ensure that the time format for `DEPARTURE_TIME` matches how times are stored in your database (this might require adjustments based on the database's convention).

Question: i need a flight from PITTSBURGH to NEW YORK leaving at 1700
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Pittsburgh to New York that departs at 1700 (5:00 PM), you will need to join the relevant tables to find flights matching those criteria. Assuming the airport codes for Pittsburgh and New York are known (let's assume they are `PIT` for Pittsburgh and `JFK` for New York), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' AND
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME LIKE '17:00%'
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight details such as flight number, departure time, arrival time, from and to airport names, airline name, number of stops, and elapsed time from the `FLIGHT` table, while joining with the `AIRLINE` and `AIRPORT` tables to bring in additional information about the airlines and airports.
- The `WHERE` clause filters to only include flights where the departure airport is Pittsburgh and the destination airport is New York, with the departure time around 1700. The `LIKE '17:00%'` is used to match any time that begins with "17:00".
  
You should ensure the airport names are accurately matched to what's stored in your database, or instead use airport codes like `PIT` for Pittsburgh and `JFK` for New York directly in the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` conditions if you have that data.

Question: is there a 400 o'clock flight from WASHINGTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a 4:00 o'clock flight from Washington to Denver, we need to look for flights from an airport in Washington to an airport in Denver. We'll also need to filter the results for the specific time.

Here is an SQL query that checks for flights leaving any Washington airport and arriving at any Denver airport around 4:00 o'clock:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON') 
    AND A2.CITY_CODE IN (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DENVER')
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 4;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects relevant flight information, including flight number and times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the main table and joins it with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the departure and once for the destination.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters to check that the departure airport is in Washington and the arrival airport is in Denver.
   - Ensures the flight departs at 4:00 o'clock (which can be checked using `HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 4`, assuming `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in a compatible `TIME` format).

Make sure you adjust the time extraction based on how the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is formatted in your database (some databases may require different functions or syntax).

Question: are there any 400 o'clock flights from WASHINGTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there are any flights from Washington to Denver at 4:00 AM, we need to query the relevant tables to find flights that connect these two locations at the specified time. This generally involves checking the FLIGHT table, joining it with the AIRPORT table to get the airport codes, and filtering for the specific departure time.

Assuming "WASHINGTON" corresponds to a particular airport code (e.g., DCA for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport or IAD for Washington Dulles International Airport) and "DENVER" corresponds to a specific airport code (e.g., DEN for Denver International Airport), you would first need to retrieve the airport codes for those cities.

Here’s how the SQL query may look:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID, f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON'
  AND a_to.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'
  AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 4
  AND EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 0;
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID, f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME`: We are selecting the flight ID, flight number, and departure time for the flights we are interested in.
- `FROM FLIGHT f`: We are querying the FLIGHT table, abbreviated as `f`.
- `JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE`: We are joining to the AIRPORT table to get airports where the flight departs from.
- `JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE`: We are joining again to find the destination airport.
- `WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON'`: Filtering for departures from Washington.
- `AND a_to.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'`: Filtering for arrivals to Denver.
- `AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 4 AND EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 0`: This condition ensures we're only getting flights that depart exactly at 4:00 AM.

Note: The names `AIRPORT_LOCATION` is used here based on your schema; adjust according to the exact column names in your database that pertain to the airport descriptions or locations. Also, depending on the SQL dialect you are using, the function to extract hours and minutes might vary.

Question: i would like a flight between BOSTON and ATLANTA on any day at one in the afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight between Boston and Atlanta scheduled for any day at one in the afternoon, you would typically need to join the relevant tables in your database. The query would likely involve the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly other relevant tables to filter for the specific airports and time. Here's an SQL query example that aligns with your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 13  -- This represents 1 PM in 24-hour format
    AND EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 0;  -- Ensure we get exactly at one PM
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT**: We select relevant columns such as flight ID, flight number, airlines, departure and arrival times, and airport names for clarity.
- **FROM**: The main table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `F`).
- **JOIN**: We're joining the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - Once to get the name of the from airport (Boston).
  - Once to get the name of the to airport (Atlanta).
- **WHERE**: We filter for flights:
  - From Boston to Atlanta.
  - Departing at exactly one in the afternoon (13:00 hours).
  
Ensure your database allows for the `EXTRACT` function. If not, you'll need to adjust the time comparison to match whatever method your database supports for filtering time.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BALTIMORE to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BALTIMORE to PITTSBURGH, we would typically join various tables to retrieve relevant flight information, airport details, fare information, and so on. Below is an SQL query that demonstrates how to retrieve this information based on your database schema.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline_Code,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS From_Airport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS To_Airport,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost,
    f.MEAL_CODE AS Meal_Code,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION AS Meal_Description
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
LEFT JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selected Columns**: We select relevant columns that represent the flight details, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, meal details, etc.
   
2. **Table Joins**:
   - `FLIGHT` is joined with `FARE` to fetch fare details associated with the flights.
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice; once for the departure airport (BALTIMORE) and once for the arrival airport (PITTSBURGH).
   - We also join with `FLIGHT_FARE` to get round trip costs associated with the flights.
   - A left join with `FOOD_SERVICE` is used to get details about meal services associated with the flight.

3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - It filters results based on the departure airport being BALTIMORE and the destination airport being PITTSBURGH.
   - It also checks that the fare requires a round trip by verifying that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'Y'.

### Note:
- Make sure to have appropriate data in the relevant tables like `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` for this query to return meaningful results.
- The actual `MEAL_CODE` and its description may not be required for all queries, so you may modify the SELECT clause as per your needs.

Question: please show me all round trip flights from BURBANK to TACOMA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from Burbank (BUR) to Tacoma (SEA), you can query the `FLIGHT` table and join it with the `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and other relevant tables to get the necessary details. However, we must check the flights in both directions (to Tacoma from Burbank and returning from Tacoma to Burbank). 

Below is an SQL query that can help achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE AND f1.AIRLINE_FLIGHT <> f2.AIRLINE_FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR' AND 
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' AND 
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA' AND 
    f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'BUR';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT f1 and f2**: We retrieve two sets of flights, one for the outbound flight (`f1`) from Burbank to Tacoma and another for the return flight (`f2`) from Tacoma to Burbank, ensuring they are on the same airline but different flight numbers.
  
2. **JOIN operations**: We perform joins on `FLIGHT_FARE` to connect the flights with their respective fare classes.

3. **WHERE clause**: 
   - Filters outbound flights (`f1`) from `BUR` to `SEA` (Tacoma).
   - Ensures that the return flights (`f2`) are from `SEA` to `BUR`.
   - Checks for round trip requirement (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` = 'Y') to confirm that these fares allow for round trips.

### Note:
Make sure to adjust the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` field values to reflect the correct codes for Burbank and Tacoma, and ensure that the flights are available for the given query conditions.

Question: give me all the flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI round trip
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round-trip flights from New York to Miami, you'll first need to identify the airport codes for New York and Miami, and then filter the `FLIGHT` table based on these codes. Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Assuming New York has multiple airports, we'll specify the relevant ones (e.g., JFK, LGA, EWR)
-- And for Miami, typically, it's MIA.

WITH NewYorkAirports AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK')
),
MiamiAirport AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI')
)

SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS OUTBOUND_COST,
    FA2.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS RETURN_COST,
    A1.AIRLINE_NAME AS OUTBOUND_AIRLINE,
    A2.AIRLINE_NAME AS RETURN_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    NewYorkAirports NYA ON F.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM NYA)
JOIN 
    MiamiAirport MA ON F.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM MA)
JOIN 
    FARE FA1 ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA1.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F2 ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = F2.AIRLINE_CODE AND F2.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM MA) AND F2.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM NYA)
JOIN 
    FARE FA2 ON F2.FLIGHT_ID = FA2.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A1 ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A1.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A2 ON F2.AIRLINE_CODE = A2.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    FA1.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' 
    AND FA2.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';

```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query starts by defining two CTEs:
   - `NewYorkAirports` selects airport codes for New York.
   - `MiamiAirport` selects the airport code for Miami.

2. **Main Query**: The main query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the airports for New York and Miami to filter flights that meet the outbound and return criteria.

3. **Fares**: We also join the `FARE` table to get the costs of the outbound and return tickets.

4. **Airlines**: Finally, we join the `AIRLINE` table to retrieve the names of the airlines for both outbound and return flights.

### Notes:
- Make sure that airport codes for New York airports (like JFK, LGA, EWR) are included in the `AIRPORT` table.
- The query assumes that both outbound and return flights are required to be round-trip and not just singular flight options. Adjust the query according to actual database field types and requirements.
- Ensure that your SQL environment does not have any issues with naming or syntax, especially with respect to your SQL dialect (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Dallas (DALLAS) to Pittsburgh (PITTSBURGH), you'll need to retrieve relevant information from several tables in the given database schema. We assume that `DALLAS` and `PITTSBURGH` are defined in the `CITY` table, and we will also gather flight details, airline information, and fare data.

Here’s an SQL query that could be used to extract the needed information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    FD.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE AS A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE AS FD ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FD.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY AS C1 ON C1.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AP1 ON C1.CITY_CODE = AP1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS C2 ON C2.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AP2 ON C2.CITY_CODE = AP2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP1.AIRPORT_CODE 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = AP2.AIRPORT_CODE
    AND FD.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Projection (`SELECT` clause)**: The query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, and `FARE` tables, which include flight details, airline names, and costs for round-trip flights.

2. **Joins**:
   - `FLIGHT` is joined with `AIRLINE` to get the names of the airlines.
   - `FARE` is joined to retrieve the cost associated with the flight.
   - `CITY` is joined twice to fetch the airport codes for both Dallas and Pittsburgh.
   - `AIRPORT` is joined with `CITY` to link city names to their respective airports.

3. **Condition (`WHERE` clause)**: It filters the flights that depart from Dallas and arrive in Pittsburgh and ensures that the fare is for a round-trip flight.

### Note:
- Ensure the city names in the `CITY` table are correctly represented (e.g., “DALLAS” and “PITTSBURGH”) as they appear in the database.
- Adjust the field names and join conditions based on the actual names used in your database if there are any discrepancies.

Question: list all round trip flights from ORLANDO to KANSAS CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from Orlando (ORL) to Kansas City (KCI), you would need to join several tables. Specifically, you would be looking at the `FLIGHT` table to get the flight details, filtering based on the origin (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and destination (`TO_AIRPORT`). You may also reference the `AIRPORT` table for any additional airport information you want.

Here's an example SQL query that retrieves round trip flights from Orlando to Kansas City:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS FlightNumber,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DepartureTime,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ArrivalTime,
    f.STOPS AS Stops,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED AS TimeElapsed,
    f.CONNECTIONS AS Connections
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando' 
    AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Kansas City'
    AND f.DUAL_CARRIER IS NULL -- Exclude dual carriers if not needed
    AND f.FLIGHT_NUMBER IN (
        SELECT FLIGHT_NUMBER 
        FROM FLIGHT 
        WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE 
        AND TO_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
    ) -- To get the return flight
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight number, airline, departure time, arrival time, stops, elapsed time, and connections.
2. **Joining Tables**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the origin airport (Orlando) and once for the destination airport (Kansas City).
3. **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters to ensure the flights are only between Orlando and Kansas City. 
4. **Round Trip**: A subquery is used to ensure there is a corresponding return flight going from Kansas City back to Orlando.
5. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` for convenience.

Make sure to refer to the correct airport codes for Orlando and Kansas City if they are different in your database schema. This query assumes the airport names are as provided.

WHERE

    AND F1.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND F1.FLIGHT_ID IN (SELECT FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE WHERE FARE.BOOKING_CLASS = 'ROUND_TRIP');  -- assuming this substitutes for round trip criteria
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT F1**: Represents the departure flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco.
2. **FLIGHT F2**: Represents the return flight from San Francisco back to Philadelphia.
3. **JOIN**: The assumption here is that the same flight number can be used for ease, which may not always be true, but serves as a simplification. If the flights have unique identifiers for round trips, you might need more specific details or conditions.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the departures and destinations for the required cities.
5. **FLIGHT_FARE**: Filtering based on fare conditions to ensure that we only return round trip options.

### Important Considerations:
- Ensure you have the correct airport codes for "PHILADELPHIA" and "SAN FRANCISCO" as per the data, which might be something like "PHL" and "SFO".
- Adjust the join condition based on how round-trip flights are distinguished in your real-world dataset if needed.
- The "ROUND_TRIP" consideration may need proper cross-reference tables or check conditions on a fare table, as the above scenario assumes a simplified relationship. 

### Note:
This query represents a basic model. You may need to adapt the column names according to actual data and include additional business logic as necessary for handling date and time constraints adequately.

Question: i would like to make a round trip between WASHINGTON and SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query for planning a round trip between Washington and San Francisco, we will first need to identify the relevant airports for both cities. After that, we can retrieve flights operating between those two airports. 

Assuming we have two airports, one in Washington and one in San Francisco, we can proceed with the query. The following SQL query outlines how to find round-trip flights between these cities.

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify the airport codes for Washington and San Francisco
WITH AirportCodes AS (
    SELECT CITY_CODE, AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION IN (
        SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'
        UNION
        SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    )
)

-- Step 2: Find round-trip flights from Washington to San Francisco and back
SELECT 
    F1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    F1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    F2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F1 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_CODES A1 ON F1.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE -- From Washington
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_CODES A2 ON F1.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE   -- To San Francisco
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F2 ON F2.FROM_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE        -- From San Francisco
               AND F2.TO_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE        -- To Washington
WHERE 
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME IS NOT NULL -- Ensure departure time is valid
    AND F2.DEPARTURE_TIME IS NOT NULL -- Ensure return flight has a valid departure time
ORDER BY 
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME, F2.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **AirportCodes CTE**: This common table expression retrieves the airport codes for both Washington and San Francisco based on their city names.
2. **Selecting Flights**: The main query retrieves outbound flights from Washington to San Francisco and pairs them with return flights from San Francisco to Washington.
3. **JOIN Conditions**: The joins ensure that the flights from Washington to San Francisco (F1) and back (F2) are properly linked based on the airport codes.
4. **Order By Clause**: The results are ordered by the departure times of the outbound and return flights for better organization.

Make sure to adjust additional filters (like flight dates, airline preference, etc.) depending on your specific needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a round trip ticket from Indianapolis to Kansas City, we will need to join various tables in the database schema provided. Here’s an example SQL query that retrieves the necessary details for round trip fares, along with flight information.

Assuming:
- **INDIANAPOLIS airport code** is "IND"
- **KANSAS CITY airport code** is "MCI"

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS DEPARTURE_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS DEPARTURE_AIRLINE,
    f1.STOPS AS DEPARTURE_STOPS,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS RETURN_AIRLINE,
    f2.STOPS AS RETURN_STOPS,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE AS FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f1
INNER JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
INNER JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
INNER JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS f2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCI' AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'IND' 
INNER JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IND' 
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCI'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'
ORDER BY 
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects details for both the departure flight (from Indianapolis to Kansas City) and the return flight (from Kansas City back to Indianapolis).
- It gathers relevant information from the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables.
- It checks to ensure that the fare requires a round-trip using `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'`.
- Adjust `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` codes according to actual values from the `AIRPORT` table if they differ from the assumed values.

Make sure to replace the airport codes and other column names based on your actual schema or to align with your data context.

Question: okay i've got somebody else who wants to take a round trip ticket from CHARLOTTE to MONTREAL
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information for a round trip ticket from CHARLOTTE to MONTREAL, we need to extract data from relevant tables including the airports for both cities, fares for the flights, and any relevant flight schedules. Below is a sample SQL query that can provide the necessary information:

```sql
-- Assume "CHARLOTTE" refers to its city code "CLT" and "MONTREAL" refers to its city code "YMQ" 
-- (this can vary, adjust as needed).
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS Departure_Airport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS Arrival_Airport,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE AS Fare_Basis,
    cs.CLASS_DESCRIPTION AS Class_of_Service
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE cs ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = cs.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'CHARLOTTE' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MONTREAL' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selected Columns**: The query retrieves flight number, departure & arrival airports, departure & arrival times, fare costs, fare basis, and class of service.
2. **Joins**: 
   - It joins the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` table twice, once for departure and once for arrival.
   - It also joins `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` to get the fare details and class of service.
3. **Where Clause**: It filters results based on the airport locations and checks if the ticket requires a round trip.
4. **Assumptions**: Specific codes for CHARLOTTE and MONTREAL may need to be adjusted based on the actual database entry (e.g., `CLT` for CHARLOTTE and possible multiple codes for MONTREAL).

### Notes:
- Ensure the city codes `CHARLOTTE` and `MONTREAL` are correctly represented in the database matching the expected field.
- You may want to further filter results for specific dates or times, depending on the user's requirements.

Make sure to replace the placeholder entries with specifics relevant to your database schema and actual city codes.

Question: show me the round trip flights between PHOENIX and SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the round trip flights between Phoenix and Salt Lake City, you can query the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. The following SQL query retrieves the necessary flight details, assuming that the airport codes for Phoenix and Salt Lake City are known (for instance, `PHX` for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and `SLC` for Salt Lake City International Airport):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FF.FARE_ID,
    Fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    Fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE Fare ON FF.FARE_ID = Fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    (F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHX' AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC')
    OR (F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SLC' AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHX')
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight details including the airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, originating and destination airports, time elapsed, and fare costs.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get the cost information associated with the flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to get flights that go from Phoenix to Salt Lake City or vice versa (for a round trip).
- `ORDER BY F.DEPARTURE_TIME` is used to sort the results based on the departure time. 

Make sure to replace `PHX` and `SLC` with the actual airport codes if they differ in your data.

Question: round trip flights between NEW YORK and MIAMI
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about round trip flights between New York and Miami from the database, you will need to construct an SQL query that filters the relevant tables based on the given criteria. The two main cities will refer to their respective airports. 

Assuming that you have the airport codes for New York and Miami, the query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FA.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FA.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'NEW YORK' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MIAMI'
    AND FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We are selecting flight information including flight ID, number, airline code, departure and arrival times, stops, elapsed time, and fares.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to identify the airports for both departure (from New York) and arrival (to Miami).
- We also join with the `FARE` table to get costs associated with the flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the records to only include flights departing from an airport in New York and arriving at an airport in Miami, while ensuring that the fare is for a round trip.

### Notes:
1. Replace `'NEW YORK'` and `'MIAMI'` with the actual `AIRPORT_CODE` or an appropriate identification that matches the `AIRPORT` schema, if necessary.
2. If the system has multiple airports for New York (like JFK and LGA), you may need another condition to filter specifically which New York airport to include.
3. Ensure that the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` condition matches how your database tracks round trip definitions (in this case, assumed as 'Y' for yes). Adjust according to your data schema.

Make any necessary adjustments depending on the actual structure of the data in your database and the precise relationship between cities and airports based on existing data.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Baltimore to Pittsburgh using the provided database schema, you would typically need to query various tables to get the necessary details about flights, airports, fares, and other relevant information. Below is an example SQL query that retrieves the necessary data for such a flight.

Assuming "BALTIMORE" and "PITTSBURGH" are the city names and you have to check against the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables first to get the corresponding airport codes, you might write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Outbound_Flight_Number,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Outbound_Departure_Time,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Outbound_Arrival_Time,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE AS Outbound_Airline_Code,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS Outbound_Cost,
    F_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT AS Outbound_Stop_Airport,
    F_FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Return_Flight_Number,
    F_return.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Return_Departure_Time,
    F_return.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Return_Arrival_Time,
    F_return.AIRLINE_CODE AS Return_Airline_Code,
    FARE_return.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS Return_Cost
FROM 
    CITY C_from 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_from ON C_from.CITY_CODE = A_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS FROM_SERVICE ON A_from.AIRPORT_CODE = FROM_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F ON A_from.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH')
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FF.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F_return ON F_return.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH') AND F_return.TO_AIRPORT = A_from.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF_return ON F_return.FLIGHT_ID = FF_return.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS FARE_return ON FF_return.FARE_ID = FARE_return.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    C_from.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE';
```

### Explanation:
1. **City Table**: We start by selecting the airport codes from the `CITY` table for Baltimore and Pittsburgh.
2. **Airport Table**: Join the `AIRPORT` table to find the corresponding airport codes.
3. **Flight Table**: Find outbound flights from Baltimore to Pittsburgh (`FROM_AIRPORT` to `TO_AIRPORT`).
4. **Flight Fare**: Get the fare details for those flights.
5. **Return Flights**: Similarly find return flights from Pittsburgh back to Baltimore.
6. **Select Relevant Columns**: The final selection includes flight numbers, departure and arrival times, airline codes, and costs for both outbound and return flights.

### Note:
Make sure to adjust the query as needed based on the actual datasets and names in your database, particularly if there are any differences in how location names or codes are stored. The query assumes there’s accurate data mapping and relationships between the referenced tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Boston to Pittsburgh, you'll need to join several tables based on their relationships and criteria such as airports, flights, fare, and other relevant details. Below is an example SQL query that demonstrates how to retrieve this information. Please note that the specific column names and conditions may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in your database.

Here is a SQL example to find round trip flight details from Boston to Pittsburgh:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Outbound_Flight_Number,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Outbound_Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Outbound_Arrival_Time,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT AS Outbound_From_Airport,
    f.TO_AIRPORT AS Outbound_To_Airport,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED AS Outbound_Duration,
    fa1.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Outbound_Round_Trip_Cost,
    
    r_f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Inbound_Flight_Number,
    r_f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Inbound_Departure_Time,
    r_f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Inbound_Arrival_Time,
    r_f.FROM_AIRPORT AS Inbound_From_Airport,
    r_f.TO_AIRPORT AS Inbound_To_Airport,
    r_f.TIME_ELAPSED AS Inbound_Duration,
    fa2.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Inbound_Round_Trip_Cost

FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff1 ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa1 ON ff1.FARE_ID = fa1.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT r_f ON r_f.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE AND r_f.TO_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff2 ON r_f.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa2 ON ff2.FARE_ID = fa2.FARE_ID

WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' AND 
    fa1.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' AND 
    fa2.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Tables**: The query contains multiple joins among the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to pull relevant data for outbound and inbound flights.
   
2. **Filter Airports**: The `WHERE` clause filters the `AIRPORT` names to find flights specifically from Boston to Pittsburgh.

3. **Round Trip Requirement**: It checks that the fare for both the outbound and inbound flights is marked as round trip required.

This query is a basic example and should be tailored further based on the precise data model and requirements of the query, such as timestamps or more specific conditions for fare filtering.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from BOSTON to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Boston to Pittsburgh, we need to join multiple tables in the database schema. We'll look up the appropriate airports for Boston and Pittsburgh, and then search for flights based on those airports.

We are interested in details for the round trip, so we will need to find flights going from Boston to Pittsburgh and then flights returning from Pittsburgh to Boston. 

Here’s an SQL query that can help retrieve the relevant details for round trip flight arrangements:

```sql
-- Assuming Boston and Pittsburgh have been mapped to their respective airport codes,
-- For example, 'BOS' for Boston Logan International Airport and 'PIT' for Pittsburgh International Airport.

SELECT 
    FLIGHT_AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME AS AIRLINE,
    OUTBOUND.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT,
    OUTBOUND.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    OUTBOUND.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    OUTBOUND.STOPS AS OUTBOUND_STOPS,
    RETURN_FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT,
    RETURN_FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    RETURN_FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    RETURN_FLIGHT.STOPS AS RETURN_STOPS,
    FARE.ROUNTRIP_COST AS ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
        F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        F.STOPS,
        F.FROM_AIRPORT,
        F.TO_AIRPORT
    FROM 
        FLIGHT F
    JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE 
        A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
    ) AS OUTBOUND
JOIN 
    (SELECT 
        F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
        F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        F.STOPS,
        F.FROM_AIRPORT,
        F.TO_AIRPORT
    FROM 
        FLIGHT F
    JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE 
        A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    ) AS RETURN_FLIGHT ON OUTBOUND.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = RETURN_FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FARE O ON O.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND O.TO_AIRPORT = 'PIT'  -- Assuming these airport codes
JOIN 
    FARE R ON R.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' AND R.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
WHERE 
    OUTBOUND.FLIGHT_NUMBER = R.FLIGHT_NUMBER;  -- Ensure they are in sync
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subquery for Outbound Flights**: The first subquery retrieves all outbound flights from Boston to Pittsburgh using JOIN operations to align the airport codes with their names.
  
2. **Subquery for Return Flights**: The second subquery finds all return flights from Pittsburgh to Boston.

3. **Joining Subqueries**: The results of the two subqueries are joined on the common `AIRLINE_FLIGHT` to get details for both the outbound and return flights.

4. **Including Fare**: We join the FARE table to retrieve fare information for both legs of the trip.

### Note:
- This sample SQL assumes known airport codes for Boston and Pittsburgh; replace 'BOSTON' and 'PITTSBURGH' with the appropriate airport names or codes in the system if they differ.
- Depending on how the database is populated, you might also want to handle cases where no flights or fares are available for the selected criteria to avoid empty results in the final output.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
-- Assuming Boston and Pittsburgh have been mapped to their respective airport codes,
-- For example, 'BOS' for Boston Logan International Airport and 'PIT' for Pittsburgh International Airport.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flights from Boston to Washington, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. The key tables to join will include `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and possibly others to retrieve additional information (like the airline name, flight timings, etc.).

Below is an SQL query that aims to provide you with round-trip flights between Boston and Washington. For this example, I will assume that the airport codes for Boston (BOS) and Washington (DCA or IAD) are known.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS From_Airport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS To_Airport,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Cost,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE AS Fare_Basis,
    fl.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline_Code,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME AS Airline_Name
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON fare.FARE_AIRLINE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    (a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston' AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Washington')
    OR (a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Washington' AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston')
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:

1. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects relevant fields including flight number, departure and arrival times, airport names, cost of the flight, fare basis, and the airline name.

2. **FROM and JOIN Clauses**:
   - It starts with the `FLIGHT` table and joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   - It also joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare details associated with the flights.
   - Additionally, it joins the `AIRLINE` table to extract the airline's name related to the fare.

3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - The condition checks for flights originating from Boston and going to Washington, or vice versa. 
   - It includes filtering on round-trip requirements.

4. **Assumptions**: 
   - Replace the airport names in the query with actual codes or names as per your actual data in the system.

Make sure to adjust any specific column names or references according to your actual database setup.

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To fetch round trip flights from St. Petersburg to Toronto, you'll need to join the relevant tables in your database schema. The key steps are to find the airport codes for both cities, then look for flights departing from St. Petersburg to Toronto and returning to St. Petersburg.

Here’s the SQL query you could use to find those round trip flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    F1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    F2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F1.FROM_AIRPORT AS OUTBOUND_FROM_AIRPORT,
    F1.TO_AIRPORT AS OUTBOUND_TO_AIRPORT,
    F2.FROM_AIRPORT AS RETURN_FROM_AIRPORT,
    F2.TO_AIRPORT AS RETURN_TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS A1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS A2 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LED'  -- St. Petersburg airport code
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS A3 ON A3.AIRPORT_CODE = 'YYZ'  -- Toronto airport code
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS F1 ON F1.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE AND F1.TO_AIRPORT = A3.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS F2 ON F2.FROM_AIRPORT = A3.AIRPORT_CODE AND F2.TO_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F1.FLIGHT_ID IN (
        SELECT FLIGHT_ID
        FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FF
        JOIN FARE AS FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
        WHERE FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    )
AND 
    F2.FLIGHT_ID IN (
        SELECT FLIGHT_ID
        FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FF
        JOIN FARE AS FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
        WHERE FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    );
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **FROM Clause:** We start from the `AIRPORT` table three times to get the airport details for both St. Petersburg and Toronto.
   - `A1` for St. Petersburg (assumed airport code is 'LED').
   - `A3` for Toronto (assumed airport code is 'YYZ').

2. **JOINs:** We join the `FLIGHT` table twice:
   - `F1` for outbound flights going from St. Petersburg to Toronto.
   - `F2` for return flights going from Toronto back to St. Petersburg.

3. **WHERE Clause:** This filters the flights to ensure we only include round trip options by checking if the fare is marked as round trip required.

### Note:
- You will need to replace 'LED' and 'YYZ' with the actual airport codes used in your database if they are different.
- Ensure that your database supports the syntax used in the SQL; if there are any specific restrictions or variations, slight alterations to the query might be needed. 
- If specific date ranges are required, you could extend the query by including conditions for `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME`.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from New York to Miami based on the provided database schema, you'll need to write a SQL query that joins the relevant tables. The query will primarily involve the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` tables, depending on how the round trip is defined.

Here is an SQL query that can achieve this, assuming that `NEW YORK` corresponds to a specific airport (e.g., JFK, LGA, EWR) and `MIAMI` corresponds to MIA (Miami International Airport):

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS ROUND_TRIP_PRICE 
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID != f2.FLIGHT_ID -- Ensure it's a different flight
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID AND f2.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE AND a1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%'
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%MIAMI%'
WHERE 
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' 
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%')
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Yes'; -- Assuming this column indicates if the fare is for a round trip
```

### Notes:
1. You should replace the airport names and codes in the query with the ones that match how they are stored in your `AIRPORT` table, as multiple airports might represent New York.
2. The condition `f1.FLIGHT_ID != f2.FLIGHT_ID` ensures you are looking at two different flights (outbound and return).
3. The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` should be checked against the specification in your `FARE` table to confirm that the fare is for a round trip.
4. You might need to adjust the SQL syntax slightly depending on the specific SQL database system you're using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

Question: list the round trip flights from ST. PAUL to SAN JOSE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the round-trip flights from St. Paul to San Jose, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. The primary tables you will likely need are `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FARE`. 

Here is an example SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE 
               AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. PAUL' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN JOSE' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT Clause**: Specifying which columns to retrieve, including flight information, airline details, departure and arrival times, as well as the round-trip fare cost.
  
- **FROM Clause**: The primary table for flights is `FLIGHT` aliased as `f` where flights are stored.

- **JOIN Operations**: 
  - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice:
    - First, to get details about the departure airport (`a1`).
    - Second, to get details about the arrival airport (`a2`).
  - The `FARE` table is joined to filter down to round-trip fares relevant to the departing and arriving airports.

- **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights from ST. PAUL to SAN JOSE and checks that the fare is valid for round-trip travel.

- **ORDER BY Clause**: Orders the results by the flight’s departure time.

This SQL query assumes that you have valid entries for the airports in the `AIRPORT` table for both ST. PAUL and SAN JOSE, and it retrieves only those flights that have round-trip requirements satisfied. Adjustments may be required based on the actual names and codes used in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip tickets from Denver (represented by its airport code) to Oakland (also represented by its airport code), we first need to identify the airport codes for these cities. Assuming you already have these airport codes (for example, `DEN` for Denver International Airport and `OAK` for Oakland International Airport), the following SQL query can be used to retrieve the information on round trip tickets between these two locations.

Here's an SQL statement that will help you fetch the round trip tickets:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'OAK'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates that it's a round trip ticket
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT clause**: Retrieves the relevant columns including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, cost, fare basis, and airline associated with the fare.
- **FROM clause**: Specifies the source tables for the query which include `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables.
- **JOIN clause**: Combines the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables based on the appropriate IDs.
- **WHERE clause**: Filters results to only include flights departing from Denver (`DEN`) and arriving at Oakland (`OAK`), ensuring that the round trip requirement is met.

Make sure to replace the airport codes with the correct ones if they differ from the assumptions made here.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from New York to Miami using the provided database schema, we will need to identify the airport codes for the cities "New York" and "Miami," then find corresponding flights that match those airports. 

Assuming the airport codes for New York and Miami are, for example, 'JFK' for John F. Kennedy International Airport and 'MIA' for Miami International Airport, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%MIAMI%' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting necessary fields**: The query selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the round trip cost.
2. **From clause with joins**:
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table on the `FLIGHT_ID`.
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table two times: once for the departure airport (from New York) and once for the arrival airport (to Miami).
3. **Where clause**:
   - We check that the departing airport's name includes "NEW YORK" (you may need the exact airport names or codes depending on your actual data).
   - We check that the arriving airport's name includes "MIAMI."
   - We also ensure that the flights are round trips by filtering with `fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`.

Make sure to adjust the airport codes or names based on the real data in your database if they differ.

Question: show me the round trip tickets from BALTIMORE to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip ticket information from Baltimore to Atlanta, you will need to join several tables to get detailed information about the flights, fares, and the airports involved. The key elements you'll need are the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `AIRPORT` tables. 

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.RESTRICTION_CODE,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM
    FARE fare
JOIN
    FLIGHT fare_flight ON fare.FARE_ID = fare_flight.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_from ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_to ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates that round trip is required
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement:** The query selects relevant columns including flight numbers, airline codes, departure and arrival times, costs for one-direction and round trip, fare basis code, and restriction code.
- **FROM Clause:** The main table is `FARE`, which contains fare information.
- **JOINs:**
    - `FLIGHT`: To link fares with flights, based on the fare's `FARE_ID` and the flight's `FLIGHT_ID`.
    - `AIRPORT`: Joined twice to get information about the departure (from Baltimore) and arrival (to Atlanta) airports.
- **WHERE Clause:** Filters results to show only flights departing from Baltimore to Atlanta that are marked as round trip required.

Make sure to adjust the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` condition in the `WHERE` clause according to the values used in your `FARE` table, as the representation of round trip requirements can vary (it may or may not use 'Y').

Raw LLM Response:
To find all round trip flights between Houston and Las Vegas, you would need to join various tables to gather relevant information about flights, their fares, and the airports. Here's a SQL query that addresses this requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    F1.FLIGHT_ID,
    F1.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F1.AIRLINE_FLIGHT AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    F1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    F2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    F2.AIRLINE_FLIGHT AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    F2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    FF1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FF2.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS RETURN_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF1 ON F1.FLIGHT_ID = FF1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA1 ON FF1.FARE_ID = FA1.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F2 ON F1.AIRLINE_FLIGHT = F2.AIRLINE_FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF2 ON F2.FLIGHT_ID = FF2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA2 ON FF2.FARE_ID = FA2.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'HOU' AND 
    F1.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAS' AND 
    FA1.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' AND 
    F2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS' AND 
    F2.TO_AIRPORT = 'HOU';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: We're selecting details about both outbound and return flights along with their costs.
2. **FROM Clause**: We start from the `FLIGHT` table `F1` for the outbound flight.
3. **JOINs**:
   - We join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get fare details for the outbound flight that indicate it’s a round trip.
   - We then join again on `FLIGHT` to find the return flight (`F2`) which has the same airline flight number (you may need to adjust this part if your requirements differ on how flights change).
   - We also fetch the fare details for the return flight through similar joins.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Specifies the conditions (flight having Houston as the departure and Las Vegas as the destination for the outbound flight, and vice versa for the return flight, ensuring the flight is round trip).

### Note:
- Make sure the airport codes like `HOU` (Houston) and `LAS` (Las Vegas) match the codes defined in your `AIRPORT` table.
- Modify the `JOIN` conditions as necessary depending on your specific requirements and data structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip ticket information for flights from Baltimore to Atlanta, you would need to make use of the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables to filter the results based on the desired airports.

Below is an example SQL query that retrieves such information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_TIME_BALTIMORE,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ARRIVAL_TIME_ATLANTA,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FARE fare
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fare_flight ON fare.FARE_ID = fare_flight.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT dep_airport ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = dep_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT arr_airport ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = arr_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    dep_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND
    arr_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip

```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight number, departure time from Baltimore, arrival time in Atlanta, and the pricing information for the ticket.

2. **JOINs**:
   - It joins the `FARE` table with the `FLIGHT` table to map fares to specific flights.
   - It also joins the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport information for both the departure (Baltimore) and arrival (Atlanta) locations.

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights departing from Baltimore and arriving in Atlanta.
   - The condition `fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures we are only retrieving round trip tickets.

Make sure to replace the `AIRPORT_NAME` values according to how they are represented in your actual database if they differ. You may need to adjust the query as necessary based on your database schema specifics (e.g., the exact names and fields).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH, you would generally want to join several tables in the database schema you provided. You need to find flights that go from the Dallas airport to a Pittsburgh airport and then back. Here's an SQL query that demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS INBOUND_FLIGHT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS INBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS INBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = f2.FLIGHT_ID AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID 
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PITTSBURGH' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Flight Selection**: The query selects two flights (f1 for outbound and f2 for inbound) using self-joins.
2. **Airport Joins**: It joins the FLIGHT table to the AIRPORT table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
3. **Fare Information**: It adds the FARE table to fetch the cost for the round trip.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to ensure the outbound flight is from a Dallas airport to a Pittsburgh airport, and the return flight goes back from Pittsburgh to Dallas. It also checks if the fare is valid for a round trip.

Make sure to replace the airport names or their properties in the above query to match the specific entries in your database. Adjust the conditions as needed based on actual data in the AIRPORT table to reflect the appropriate airport codes.

Question: show me the round trip tickets from BALTIMORE to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip ticket information from Baltimore to Dallas, you would typically join several tables in the database schema provided. We will primarily focus on the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT` tables to get the necessary information.

Here's a SQL query that shows the round trip tickets from Baltimore to Dallas:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS From_Airport,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS To_Airport,
    FT.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline_Code
FROM 
    FARE FT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE F_F ON FT.FARE_ID = F_F.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F ON F_F.FLIGHT_ID = F.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON FT.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON FT.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS' AND 
    FT.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Here we are selecting the flight number, from/to airport names, round trip cost, departure and arrival times, and the airline code.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FARE` table which contains the pricing information.

3. **JOINs**:
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` is joined to get the associated flight data for the fare.
   - `FLIGHT` table is joined to get specific flight details like departure and arrival times.
   - Two `AIRPORT` tables are joined to get the names of the originating ("From_Airport") and destination ("To_Airport") airports based on their codes.

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters to ensure we are only looking at flights from Baltimore to Dallas and where the ticket is marked as a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).

Make sure to adjust the airport names in the SQL query if the actual airport codes are needed (sometimes the contexts might differ, like whether they're IATA codes or full airport names).

Question: give me all the flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI round trip
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from New York to Miami, you would typically join multiple tables involved in the flight data, and apply filters for the necessary departure and arrival airports.

Assuming the airport codes for New York and Miami are `NYC` for New York (representing multiple airports) and `MIA` for Miami, the SQL query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.MEAL_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'NEW YORK')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MIAMI')
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT Statement**: This selects various flight-related columns, including the departure and arrival times, airline details, and fare information.
- **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source of data.
- **JOIN Clause**: The query includes a join with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names, and with the `FARE` table to access fare details.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to ensure flights are departing from any airport located in New York and arriving in Miami.
- **IN Subqueries**:
  - The first subquery selects airport codes where the location is New York.
  - The second subquery selects airport codes for Miami.
- **ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED**: Filter to ensure that the selects are only for round trip flights (assumed to be marked with 'Y').

Make sure to adjust `AIRPORT_LOCATION` filters if your database schema uses specific airport codes or other identifiers for cities.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip flight from Boston to Pittsburgh, you need to perform a SQL query that joins several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you'll want to join the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to filter flights based on the departure and arrival airports, as well as any required fare information.

Here's an example SQL query that retrieves round trip flights from Boston (BOS) to Pittsburgh (PIT):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS Departure_Airport,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS Arrival_Airport,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,

    C1.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND 
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'  -- Select only round trip flights
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns that should be returned.
- **FROM**: Indicates the main table to query against (`FLIGHT`).
- **JOIN**: Combines rows from different tables based on related columns.
- **WHERE**: Filters results to find flights that depart from Boston and arrive in Pittsburgh, ensuring it's a round-trip flight.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results by the departure time to make it easier to view flights chronologically.

**Note**: Replace `FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID` with a valid reference based on your database schema since it assumes a pre-existing relationship between `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FLIGHT`. Also, replace 'BOSTON' and 'PITTSBURGH' with the correct airport codes if they're needed based on the actual data.

Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from Boston to Pittsburgh, we'll need to query multiple tables to gather the relevant details. Here's an SQL query that combines several of those tables to retrieve the necessary flight information. 

**Assumption:** 
- The city code for Boston is 'BOS' and for Pittsburgh it is 'PIT'. 
- The query also includes details such as flight number, departure and arrival times, and fare information.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_No,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT AS From_Airport,
    f.TO_AIRPORT AS To_Airport,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost,
    airline.AIRLINE_NAME AS Airline_Name
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE airline ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = airline.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'PIT' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT**: We select the relevant fields such as Flight Number, Departure Time, Arrival Time, From Airport, To Airport, One Way Cost, Round Trip Cost, and Airline Name.
- **FROM**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which contains flight details.
- **JOIN**: We join other tables, such as `AIRLINE` for the airline name, `FLIGHT_FARE` for the fare associated with the flight, and `FARE` for cost information.
- **WHERE**: We filter for flights that depart from Boston ('BOS') and arrive in Pittsburgh ('PIT'), and only include fares that are marked as round trip required.
- **ORDER BY**: We order the results by departure time for better clarity.

This query will give you a list of round trip flights from Boston to Pittsburgh along with their details. You might need to adjust the CITY_CODE values as per your actual database records.

Question: find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a round trip flight from DALLAS to PITTSBURGH using the provided database schema, you need to join several tables to retrieve relevant information such as flights, fares, and any other necessary details. 

You can use the following SQL query as a basis to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' -- Ensuring it's a round trip flight
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects flight numbers, airline codes, departure and arrival times, both one-way and round trip costs, and names of the departure and arrival airports.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which contains information about flights.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - The `FARE` table is joined to get costs associated with the flights.
   - The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice: once to get details about the departure airport (DALLAS) and once for the arrival airport (PITTSBURGH).

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - It filters results to show only flights departing from DALLAS and arriving in PITTSBURGH, ensuring that the round trip fares are included by checking `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`.

### Notes:
- If airport codes are used instead of names, adjust the filter accordingly.
- You might want to consider adding additional conditions such as date and time if you need a more refined result based on travel dates. 
- Ensure your database has the relevant data matching the specified conditions.

Question: list round trip flights from ORLANDO to KANSAS CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list round trip flights from Orlando to Kansas City, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights with the specified departure and arrival locations, filtering for round trip fares. You'll also join with the relevant tables for airports to match city names with their respective airport codes.

Here’s an SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS DEPARTURE_AIRLINE,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS DEPARTURE_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS RETURN_AIRLINE,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_FLIGHT_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    f1.TO_AIRPORT AS DESTINATION_AIRPORT,
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT AS RETURN_AIRPORT,
    f2.TO_AIRPORT AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS f2 ON fare.FARE_AIRLINE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare2 ON ff2.FARE_ID = fare2.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' AND
    fare2.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. We select necessary fields for both the departure and return flights.
2. We join `FLIGHT` twice: once for departure (`f1`) and once for return (`f2`).
3. We join `FARE`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` to filter for round trip flights.
4. We also join the `AIRPORT` table twice to find the airport codes corresponding to Orlando and Kansas City.
5. The `WHERE` clause specifies the cities and ensures that both flights are required to be round trips.

Make sure to adjust airport names in the query according to how they are recorded in your `AIRPORT` table, as they could differ (for example, ORLANDO might have multiple associated airports).

Question: i want to fly from BALTIMORE to DALLAS round trip
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To craft an SQL query for a round trip flight from Baltimore to Dallas, we first need to identify the respective airport codes for Baltimore and Dallas. We'll assume BWI is Baltimore/Washington International Airport and DFW is Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

Here’s an SQL query that selects round trip flights based on these assumptions:

```sql
-- Selecting round trip flights from Baltimore (BWI) to Dallas (DFW)
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fd.MEAL_CODE,
    fd.COMPONENT, 
    fd.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE fd ON f.MEAL_CODE = fd.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BWI' AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DFW'
AND 
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip flight
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Involved**: 
   - `FLIGHT`: Contains the flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: Links flights to their associated fares.
   - `FARE`: Contains the fare details, including round trip requirements.
   - `FLIGHT_STOP`: Provides additional information on any flight stops.
   - `FOOD_SERVICE`: Used to join meal services for the flight (if needed).

2. **Selected Fields**: The query retrieves relevant fields such as flight number, departure and arrival times, stops, and associated fare details. You can modify the selected columns based on what specific information you want to retrieve.

3. **Filtering Conditions**: 
   - The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from BWI and arriving at DFW.
   - It also checks if the fare is marked as requiring a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` assumed value as 'Y').

Please remember to adjust the column names and conditions as per the actual values represented in your database schema, particularly for the airport codes and any other specific filters you may wish to apply.

```

### Explanation:
- The query selects details of departure flights (from Houston to Las Vegas) and their respective return flights (from Las Vegas back to Houston).
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table twice, once for the outbound flight (`f1`) and once for the return flight (`f2`).
- The join condition ensures that a valid return flight is selected after the departure flight has arrived.
- The `FARE` table is joined to retrieve costs associated with the round trip.
- The `AIRPORT` table is used to filter flights based on the specified airport locations (Houston and Las Vegas).
- The result is ordered by the departure time for better readability.

### Note:
This query will need adjustments (like rephrasing the airport codes or adding specific filters) depending on how cities/airports are defined in your actual data. You would need the actual codes for the Houston and Las Vegas airports in your database.

Question: which flights go from NEW YORK to MIAMI and back
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights that go from New York to Miami and then return, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you have the codes for New York and Miami airports. For this example, I'll assume the airport codes are:

- New York: JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport)
- Miami: MIA (Miami International Airport)

You'll need to adapt the airport codes as necessary if they differ. Here’s the SQL query that retrieves the relevant flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS OUTBOUND_AIRLINE,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS RETURN_AIRLINE,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE -- Assuming you'd likely want flights from the same airline
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' AND 
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' AND 
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MIA' AND 
    f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'JFK'
ORDER BY 
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME, f2.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT f1**: Represents the first leg of the journey from New York (JFK) to Miami (MIA).
- **FLIGHT f2**: Represents the return leg of the journey from Miami (MIA) to New York (JFK).
- The `JOIN` operation links the two legs based on the same airline, which is optional and could be removed if you want to find any different airlines.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from JFK to MIA and from MIA back to JFK.
- The results are ordered by the departure times of both flights for clarity.

Ensure to replace 'JFK' and 'MIA' with the correct airport codes if they are different in your database.

Question: round trip flights from ORLANDO to MONTREAL please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal using the provided database schema, we need to join several tables, namely `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, and any other relevant tables to get the necessary flight details and ensure we meet the round trip requirement. 

Assuming "ORLANDO" corresponds to an airport code such as "MCO" and "MONTREAL" corresponds to "YUL" (along with the flight fare information), the SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS ONE_WAY_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MONTREAL' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Columns:** This retrieves the flight numbers and departure/arrival times for both outbound and return flights and the costs associated with fares.
2. **Joins:** We join `FLIGHT` for both outbound and return flights, ensuring we relate to the appropriate `AIRPORT` names and codes.
3. **Where Clause:** This filters the results to only return flights from Orlando to Montreal as well as ensuring the round trip requirement is met.
4. **Fare Condition:** It checks whether a round trip is required for the fare (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field).

Note: You might need to adjust airport codes and ensure actual airport data matches the ones from your table.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for round trip flights from Burbank (BUR) to Seattle (SEA), you need to join several tables based on the relationships in your database schema. Here's an SQL query that retrieves the relevant flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS OUTBOUND_AIRLINE,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS RETURN_AIRLINE,
    fa_one.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS ROUND_TRIP_PRICE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1 
JOIN 
    FARE fa_one ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fa_one.FARE_ID 
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR' 
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
    AND fa_one.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = f2.FLIGHT_ID -- Assuming return flight information could be determined through FLIGHT_LEG as f2.
JOIN 
    FARE fa_return ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = fa_return.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'BUR'
    AND fa_return.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Desired Columns**: The query selects the flight number, departure and arrival times, and airline codes for both outbound and return flights, along with the cost of a round trip fare.
  
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FARE` table to retrieve fare details.
   - The outbound flight from BUR to SEA is defined in the first part of the query.
   - Then, a similar join is made for the return flight from SEA to BUR.

3. **Filtering Criteria**: The query includes conditions to ensure that the flights are round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`) and specifies the departure and arrival airports.

### Note:
- The query assumes that there are direct relationships set up between the outbound and return flights, which is often common in flight databases. Adjustments may be needed if the schema has additional complexity (like different identifiers or additional tables for leg information).
- Make sure to replace placeholders for any column names or relationships if they differ in your actual database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal, we first need to identify the corresponding airport codes for both locations. Assuming that "ORLANDO" refers to Orlando International Airport (MCO) and "MONTREAL" refers to Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (YUL), we will use these codes in our SQL query.

The process involves fetching flights from Orlando to Montreal, and then returning flights from Montreal back to Orlando. We will consider the ROUND_TRIP_COST from the FARE table to ensure that we're only looking for round trip options.

Here is an SQL query that combines the necessary tables to get round trip flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    fare1.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare1.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FARE fare1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare1.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON fare1.FARE_AIRLINE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = fare2.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND 
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'YUL' AND 
    fare1.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' AND
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' AND 
    f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO';
```

### Explanation:
- **Aliases** `f1` and `f2` are used for the outbound and return flights, respectively.
- The JOINs between the `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables are used to ensure that we can access both flight details and fare information.
- The query specifically filters for outbound flights originating from 'MCO' (Orlando) to 'YUL' (Montreal) and return flights from 'YUL' to 'MCO'.
- The condition `fare1.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures we're retrieving round trip flights.
  
Make sure to adjust the airport codes if they differ based on your specific database entries.

Question: show me round trips between MONTREAL and ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trips between Montreal (assuming the airport code is YUL) and Orlando (assuming the airport code is MCO), we can structure a SQL query based on the available schema. The query will involve joining multiple tables to filter the flights with the necessary details.

Here is an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS TOTAL_COST,
    a1.AIRLINE_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRLINE,
    a2.AIRLINE_NAME AS RETURN_AIRLINE

FROM FLIGHT AS f1
JOIN AIRLINE AS a1 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = a1.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT AS f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = f2.FLIGHT_ID -- Joining round trip legs (assuming the same flight ID for return)
JOIN FARE_FARE AS fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' AND 
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND 
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND 
    f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'YUL'
```

### Key Points:

1. **Before using this query, ensure to have the correct airport codes for Montreal and Orlando**. The query uses 'YUL' for Montreal and 'MCO' for Orlando.
   
2. **It assumes there are direct round trips available.** If the structure of your dataset distinguishes return flights with separate flight IDs (i.e., different IDs for departure and return), you need to adapt your joins accordingly.

3. **Join with FARE_FARE:** Our query is pulling fare information; ensure it is correctly linked to get the round trip costs.

4. **Consider Adjustments Based on Available Data:** Depending on the available data and how the database represents return flights, you may need to adjust the conditions or joins in the SQL statement.

Feel free to modify the query further based on additional requirements or constraints you might have!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Montreal to Orlando, we will need to join multiple tables to extract the necessary flight information, including details about the departure and return flights. The relevant tables to use in this query are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly others to complete the necessary details (like airline names and aircraft descriptions).

Assuming Montreal is represented by its airport code "YUL" and Orlando by "MCO", here’s a SQL query to find round-trip flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS DEPARTURE_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS DEPARTURE_AIRLINE,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS DEPARTURE_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT AS DEPARTURE_FROM_AIRPORT,
    f1.TO_AIRPORT AS DEPARTURE_TO_AIRPORT,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS RETURN_AIRLINE,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT AS RETURN_FROM_AIRPORT,
    f2.TO_AIRPORT AS RETURN_TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE 
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID AND f2.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO' 
    AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'YUL'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- The query uses aliases `f1` and `f2` for flights, where `f1` is for the departure flight from Montreal to Orlando, and `f2` is for the return flight from Orlando to Montreal.
- `JOIN` statements ensure that we link the two flights to verify they have the same airline.
- We check whether the flights leave from the respective airports and are round trip by filtering out with the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field.
- Finally, the relevant fields are selected to represent both flights and any associated costs.

Make sure to replace 'YUL' and 'MCO' with the correct airport codes if they differ, and ensure that your database has the appropriate data to match these codes. Adjust the field names if necessary based on your actual table definitions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flights from Burbank to Tacoma, you would typically want to join several tables, including `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` to gather all relevant details (like fare information and schedules). Below is a sample SQL query to fetch round-trip flights from Burbank to Tacoma:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS "Flight Number",
    F.AIRLINE_CODE AS "Airline Code",
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS "Departure Time",
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS "Arrival Time",
    F.FROM_AIRPORT AS "From Airport",
    F.TO_AIRPORT AS "To Airport",
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS "One Way Cost",
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS "Round Trip Cost",
    F.FLIGHT_ID AS "Flight ID"
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TACOMA' AND
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve, including flight details and costs.
- **FROM Clause**: Indicates the main table we are querying (`FLIGHT`).
- **JOINs**: We join with `FLIGHT_FARE` to get the fare details and with `FARE` to fetch cost information. We also join with `AIRPORT` twice to match the departure and arrival airports.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights going from Burbank to Tacoma and ensures that only round-trip fares are displayed. 

### Assumptions:
- The airport names, 'BURBANK' and 'TACOMA', match what is in the `AIRPORT` table.
- The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` column in the `FARE` table indicates whether the fare is for a round trip.
- Adjust field names and table names as necessary depending on your actual database settings.

Raw LLM Response:
To book a round trip flight from Kansas City to Chicago, you would generally need to gather information related to the available flights, fares, and any other necessary details. Below is an example SQL query to retrieve the available flights and fares for a round trip from Kansas City to Chicago.

This example assumes that you want to find out available flights and their corresponding fares. Note that you would also need to perform additional actions to complete a booking, such as confirming passenger details and payment information. This query focuses on finding available flights:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find city codes for Kansas City and Chicago
WITH CityCodes AS (
    SELECT CITY_CODE 
    FROM CITY 
    WHERE CITY_NAME IN ('KANSAS CITY', 'CHICAGO')
),
-- Step 2: Find available flights from Kansas City to Chicago
AvailableFlights AS (
    SELECT 
        F.FLIGHT_ID,
        F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        F.AIRLINE_CODE,
        F.STOPS,
        F.TIME_ELAPSED,
        F.FROM_AIRPORT,
        F.TO_AIRPORT
    FROM FLIGHT F
    JOIN CityCodes CC_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = CC_FROM.CITY_CODE
    JOIN CityCodes CC_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = CC_TO.CITY_CODE
),
-- Step 3: Find corresponding fares for the available flights
FlightFares AS (
    SELECT 
        AF.FLIGHT_ID,
        FFA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
        FFA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
    FROM AvailableFlights AF
    JOIN FLIGHT_FARE FFA ON AF.FLIGHT_ID = FFA.FLIGHT_ID
)

-- Finally, select flight details along with fares
SELECT 
    AF.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    AF.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    AF.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    AF.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FF.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FF.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM AvailableFlights AF
JOIN FlightFares FF ON AF.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
ORDER BY AF.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation
1. **CityCodes CTE**: This part finds the `CITY_CODE` for both Kansas City and Chicago.
2. **AvailableFlights CTE**: This part retrieves available flights from Kansas City to Chicago, including airline details and flight timings.
3. **FlightFares CTE**: This segment fetches the fare details associated with the available flights.
4. **Final SELECT**: Combines all the data to give you a comprehensive view of available flights along with their fare options.

### Note
- Ensure the `CITY` table contains the correct names and entries for Kansas City and Chicago, as queries depend on actual data in the database.
- Flight availability may also depend on the date, so consider including a date filter based on the desired travel dates.

Question: on a flight from SAN FRANCISCO to ATLANTA that leaves before 800 is there such a flight
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from San Francisco to Atlanta that departs before 8:00 AM, you would need to write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables and filters the results based on the specified criteria. 

Assuming we have the relevant airport codes for San Francisco (SFO) and Atlanta (ATL), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
       FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
       FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
       FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
       FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco'
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Atlanta'
  AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

Make sure to adjust the table names and field names if they differ from the schema you provided. 

### Explanation of the Query:
- We are selecting relevant columns such as the airline code, flight number, departure time, and arrival time from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We perform a join on the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (San Francisco) and once for the arrival airport (Atlanta) based on their airport codes.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights that depart from San Francisco to Atlanta before 8:00 AM. 

You would run this SQL query on your database management system to check if such flights exist. If no rows are returned, that means there are no flights meeting the specified conditions.

Question: hi i need to get a flight from MEMPHIS to SALT LAKE CITY departing before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Memphis to Salt Lake City that depart before 10:00 AM, you will need to query the relevant tables in your database schema. Here's an example of how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY')
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- **SELECT**: This section lists the columns you want to retrieve. You can choose to add more or remove any as needed.
  
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Specifies the main table from which to retrieve flight data.

- **JOIN clauses**: These joins connect the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRPORT` and `AIRLINE` tables in order to get additional information about the airports and airlines involved.

- **WHERE clause**:
  - The first two conditions filter the source and destination airports based on the `CITY_NAME`.
  - The third condition filters the flights to only include those that depart before 10:00 AM.

Make sure to adjust the query according to any specifics in your actual database, such as different time formats or additional filtering criteria!

Question: all flights from SAN FRANCISCO to BOSTON leaving before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from San Francisco to Boston leaving before 12:00 PM, you will need to join multiple tables to filter by the departure airport (San Francisco), arrival airport (Boston), and the departure time. Here’s an example SQL query based on your database schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT, 
    air.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE air ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = air.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12;
```

### Notes:
- The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12` condition is used to filter flights departing before noon. If the `DEPARTURE_TIME` includes date information or time zone offsets, you may need to adjust this condition accordingly.
- Make sure that the names of the airports ('SAN FRANCISCO' and 'BOSTON') match exactly with how they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table.
- If you require additional information (such as flight duration or equipment details), you can add more columns to the `SELECT` statement as needed.

Question: please give me a flight from BOSTON to ATLANTA before 1000 in the morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Boston to Atlanta before 10:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that 'BOSTON' corresponds to the airport code associated with Boston (which you'll need to know) and 'ATLANTA' corresponds to the airport code for Atlanta.

Here’s a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT

1. You need to replace `'BOSTON'` and `'ATLANTA'` with the actual airport names if necessary or make sure they directly correspond to the names stored in the `AIRPORT` table.
2. The format for `DEPARTURE_TIME` in the `FLIGHT` table should be in `HH:MM:SS` format. If it's stored differently, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.
3. Adjust the select statement based on your needs, such as including more or fewer columns or joining additional tables for more detailed information.

Question: all flights before 1000 BOSTON DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Boston to Denver that depart before 10:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that "BOSTON" and "DENVER" are represented by their respective airport codes in the `FLIGHT` table. For this example, let's assume the airport codes for BOSTON and DENVER are `BOS` and `DEN`. You can adjust the airport codes as needed based on your actual data.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
  AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Breakdown of the Query
- `SELECT *` retrieves all columns for the matching flights.
- `FROM FLIGHT` indicates that we are querying the `FLIGHT` table.
- `WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS'` filters the flights to only those departing from BOSTON.
- `AND TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'` further filters the results to only those arriving in DENVER.
- `AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'` restricts the results to flights that depart before 10 AM.

Make sure to replace `'BOS'` and `'DEN'` with the correct airport codes if they are different in your database schema.

Question: what flights go from BOSTON to DENVER before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that go from Boston to Denver before 10:00 AM (1000 hours), we will first need to identify the airport codes for Boston and Denver, and then query the `FLIGHT` table for relevant flights. Assuming that `BOSTON` corresponds to the airport code `BOS` and `DENVER` corresponds to the airport code `DEN`, we would build the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
  AND ARRIVAL_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

This query selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is 'BOS' (Boston), the `TO_AIRPORT` is 'DEN' (Denver), and the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is before 10:00 AM. 

Make sure to adjust the time format if necessary based on how the time is recorded in your database schema, as it may include date parts as well.

Question: show me all flights from PITTSBURGH to BOSTON which leave before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Pittsburgh to Boston that depart before noon (1200), you will need to construct a SQL query that joins the relevant tables based on the relationships among them. In this case, you'll want to join the `FLIGHT` table on `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`, while also ensuring you filter for flights that match the desired departure and arrival cities. 

Assuming that the airport codes for Pittsburgh and Boston are 'PIT' and 'BOS' respectively, here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS' 
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '1200';
```

Make sure to replace `F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '1200'` with the actual format used in your `DEPARTURE_TIME` column if it is stored in a different format (for example, using a time data type). This query selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline code, connections, and stops for all flights matching the criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Boston to Atlanta that depart before 8:00 AM, you'll need to query the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to identify the airport codes for Boston and Atlanta. Assuming that the airport codes for Boston (BOS) and Atlanta (ATL) are what we typically expect, you can create a SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BOS' -- Boston Airport Code
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ATL' -- Atlanta Airport Code
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00'; -- Depart before 8 AM
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects flight details such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and the names of the originating and destination airports.

2. **Joins**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the source airport (Boston) and once for the destination airport (Atlanta). 

3. **Filters**: The `WHERE` clause ensures that the flights are specifically from the Boston airport (`'BOS'`) to the Atlanta airport (`'ATL'`) and that they depart before 8:00 AM.

Make sure to adjust the airport codes (`'BOS'` and `'ATL'`) if your schema has different codes for them. Also, confirm the correct format for `DEPARTURE_TIME` based on your database's data type and format.

Question: please list all the flights from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO leaving before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Boston (using its airport code) to San Francisco (using its airport code) that leave before 10:00 AM, you will need to write a SQL query that leverages the `FLIGHT` table and references the appropriate airport codes from the `AIRPORT` table.

First, let's assume the airport codes for Boston and San Francisco are `BOS` and `SFO`, respectively. You can adjust the airport codes accordingly if needed.

Here’s an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco' AND 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Chooses the specific columns you want to display.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: Indicates the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source for flight information.
- **JOIN AIRPORT A1** and **JOIN AIRPORT A2**: This makes sure you're getting the correct airport details for both the departure and arrival airports.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to ensure you only get flights from Boston to San Francisco and only those that depart before 10:00 AM.

Make sure to replace `'Boston'` and `'San Francisco'` with the actual names or ensure that the filters are set to use the correct airport codes (e.g., `FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS'` and `TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'`) if you prefer to use airport codes directly.

Question: show me flights from TAMPA to ST. LOUIS leaving before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Tampa to St. Louis that depart before 10:00 AM, you would typically need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for both cities. The SQL query below assumes that "TAMPA" and "ST. LOUIS" correspond to their respective airport codes in the `AIRPORT` table.

Here's a SQL query that shows the flights meeting your criteria:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TAMPA' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS'
    AND CAST(F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight information.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and once for the arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`).
- It filters the results to include only flights where the departure airport is Tampa, the arrival airport is St. Louis, and the departure time is before 10:00 AM.
- The `CAST` function is used to ensure that `DEPARTURE_TIME` is treated as a time for the comparison. Make sure to adjust the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field if it is stored in a different format (date/time or string). 

### Note:
- Replace 'TAMPA' and 'ST. LOUIS' with the actual airport names as they appear in your `AIRPORT` table if they differ.
- If there are specific time zones to consider for departure times, you may need to add additional logic to account for those.

Question: please give me all flights from DALLAS to OAKLAND before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Dallas to Oakland before 12:00 PM, you would typically need to join several tables, specifically the `FLIGHT` table (which contains flight information, including departure times and airports), and potentially filter by airport codes since you need to match specific cities.

Assuming that "DALLAS" and "OAKLAND" refer to specific airport codes (for the sake of this example, let’s assume Dallas is represented by 'DFW' and Oakland by 'OAK'), your SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DALLAS%' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%OAKLAND%' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve (you can add more fields as needed).
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Specifies the main table from which to retrieve the data (the FLIGHT table).
- `JOIN AIRPORT A1`: Joins the `AIRPORT` table to match flights leaving from Dallas.
- `JOIN AIRPORT A2`: Joins the `AIRPORT` table to match flights arriving at Oakland.
- `WHERE`: Filters the results to ensure the departure airport matches Dallas and arrival matches Oakland, and the departure time is before noon.

Make sure to replace the airport names 'DALLAS' and 'OAKLAND' with the appropriate airport codes if they differ from 'DFW' and 'OAK', and check the `DEPARTURE_TIME` format according to how it's stored in your database. This query assumes that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in a format (like 'HH:MM:SS') that allows a direct comparison with '12:00:00'. Adjust accordingly if the time is represented differently.

Question: are there any flights from DALLAS FORT WORTH to BOSTON leaving before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS FORT WORTH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) to Boston (BOS) that leave before 10:00 AM, we can use the `FLIGHT` table to query the arrival and departure airports, along with filtering the departure times. 

Assuming `FROM_AIRPORT` represents Dallas Fort Worth and `TO_AIRPORT` represents Boston, the SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DFW'
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
  AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We select all columns with `SELECT *`
- Filter flights using the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields to find flights from DFW to BOS.
- We use `DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'` to ensure we only select flights that leave before 10:00 AM. 

Note: Ensure the time format matches how it's stored in the database; the exact field names may need to be adjusted based on schema specifics.

Question: i'm looking for flights from OAKLAND to ATLANTA leaving before 1045
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Oakland to Atlanta leaving before 10:45, you'll need to join several tables in your database schema that are relevant for your query: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially a few others for getting necessary information such as airport codes and flight times. 

Here is an SQL query that fulfills your requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:45:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: This part selects columns that you want to display in the result, including flight number, airline information, departure time, and airport names.
- **FROM**: The primary table is `FLIGHT`, which contains the flight details.
- **JOIN**: The query joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both FROM and TO airports.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Oakland and flying to Atlanta, and it constrains the departure time to be earlier than 10:45 AM.

Make sure to adjust the query in case the airport names or any other columns are stored in a different format in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia leaving before 9:00 AM, you will need to join the relevant tables, specifically focusing on the **FLIGHT** table and the **CITY** table to ensure you're fetching flights between the specified cities. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND 
    C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' AND 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve, including the airline code, flight number, departure time, and arrival time.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: This is where we start querying from the `FLIGHT` table, aliasing it as `F`.
- **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table to get the corresponding `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`. Then we join the `CITY` table to ensure we are selecting flights from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.
- **WHERE**: This is where we filter the results to only include flights that are departing from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and whose departure time is before 9:00 AM.

Make sure that the actual table and column names match those in your database schema if there are any discrepancies.

Question: okay i'm looking for a flight from TAMPA to ST. LOUIS leaving before 1000 any day
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Tampa to St. Louis leaving before 10:00 AM any day, you will need to join several tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially others depending on how you want to filter or sort additional details (like airline, aircraft, etc.). 

Here's a SQL query that can help you retrieve such flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TAMPA' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the SQL query:
- We select various columns from the `FLIGHT` table and join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Tampa) and once for the arrival airport (St. Louis).
- We filter the results where the FROM_AIRPORT matches Tampa and TO_AIRPORT matches St. Louis, and that the DEPARTURE_TIME is before 10:00 AM.
- Ensure the time format in the database matches how you input "10:00:00" for accurate comparisons. Adjust the format if necessary.

Be sure to adjust the WHERE clause depending on the exact airport codes or names used in your database, as there may be variations!

Question: could you tell me what morning flights are available from OAKLAND to DENVER before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find morning flights from Oakland (presumably using OAK as the airport code) to Denver (using DEN as the airport code) that depart before 10:00 AM, you'll need to query the `FLIGHT` table while filtering based on the desired airports and the departure time. 

The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We're selecting relevant fields such as flight number, airline code, departure time, destination airport, and aircraft code sequence.
- **FROM**: We're querying from the `FLIGHT` table using an alias `f`.
- **WHERE**: We're applying the necessary filters:
  - `f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK'` to specify flights leaving from Oakland.
  - `f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'` for flights heading to Denver.
  - `f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'` to capture only those flights that depart prior to 10:00 AM.

Make sure that the time format being used matches the format stored in your database (in this case, 'HH:MM:SS'). If the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field holds the time in a different format (like a datetime), you may need to use relevant functions to extract the time portion.

FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE

    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'

Question: i need to fly from BOSTON to BALTIMORE please give me the times of your flights in the morning before 800 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight times from Boston to Baltimore for flights departing before 8:00 AM, you'll need to join several tables, primarily the `FLIGHT` table and potentially the `AIRPORT` table for filtering based on the airport codes associated with Boston and Baltimore. 

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Assuming 'BOS' is the airport code for Boston and 'BWI' is the airport code for Baltimore
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

Notes:
- Ensure that the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields contain the corresponding airport codes for Boston and Baltimore (you may need to look up or adjust the airport codes accordingly).
- The time format in the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field should match the time format in the query (usually in 'HH:MM:SS' format).
- The query retrieves the airline code, flight number, departure time, and arrival time for the flights you are interested in. Adjust the fields in the SELECT clause as needed based on your preferences.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query flight times from Boston to Baltimore in the morning (before 8:00 AM), you'll need to join multiple tables to get relevant flight details, including flight numbers and departure times. Assuming your table structure and column names are correct, the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: This part is used to specify the columns you want to retrieve: flight number, departure/arrival times, and from/to airport names.
2. **FROM CLause**: It specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the starting point of the data to retrieve.
3. **JOIN Statements**: 
    - The first join with the `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `A_FROM`) is to get detail about the originating airport (Boston).
    - The second join with the `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `A_TO`) is to get detail about the destination airport (Baltimore).
4. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results to ensure flights:
    - Depart from Boston to Baltimore.
    - Depart before 8:00 AM (`< '08:00:00'`).

Make sure to use the correct airport codes in your database or adjust the city names as needed to match the data stored in your tables.

To retrieve a flight from Cleveland to Dallas that departs before 12:00 noon, you would want to query the `FLIGHT` table, ensuring to join it with the `AIRPORT` table to find the relevant airport codes for Cleveland and Dallas, as well as filter based on the departure time. 

Assuming that the airport codes for Cleveland and Dallas are known (for example, "CLE" for Cleveland and "DFW" for Dallas, this may vary based on your data set), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT clause**: Specifies the fields to be retrieved, including flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline code, and names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM clause**: The main table queried is the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as F).
3. **JOIN clause**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice - one for the departure airport (Cleveland) and one for the arrival airport (Dallas).
4. **WHERE clause**: Filters the results to flights departing from Cleveland to Dallas before noon (12:00 PM).
   
Note: Ensure the airport names match exactly as they appear in your database. If you need specifics like the airport codes, you'll have to look them up or modify the query accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the flights from Cleveland to Dallas that leave before 12:00 PM, you can join the relevant tables and use a WHERE condition for the departure airport, arrival airport, and departure time. Below is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'CLE'    -- Assuming the city code for Cleveland is 'CLE'
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'DFW' -- Assuming the city code for Dallas is 'DFW'
    AND TIME_FORMAT(F.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%H:%i') < '12:00';
```

Make sure to replace `'CLE'` and `'DFW'` with the actual city codes for Cleveland and Dallas if they are different. The `TIME_FORMAT` function is used to format the time for comparison. Adjust this part based on the actual data type of the `DEPARTURE_TIME` in your database.

Question: list flights before 900 from CINCINNATI to TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 9:00 AM, you would need to join the relevant tables and apply the necessary filters. Here’s how you could write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'CINCINNATI' -- Assuming there's a mapping from CITY_CODE to AIRPORT
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'TAMPA'    -- Same assumption as above
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 9
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Key Points:
1. **Table Joins**: We're joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice — once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
2. **City Code Mapping**: This query assumes that city codes or airport codes are used to filter for airports in Cincinnati and Tampa. The actual mapping will depend on how the data is structured in your database.
3. **Time Extraction**: The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ...)` function is used to filter flights that depart before 9:00 AM. The exact usage may differ based on the SQL dialect in use.
4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME`. 

### Note:
Make sure that `CITY_CODE` properly corresponds to actual values in your `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT` tables if needed. You might have to adjust the code to match your specific schema or use proper values for the filters.

Question: list flights from CINCINNATI to TAMPA before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Cincinnati to Tampa before 12:00 PM (noon), we would typically need to join several tables in the database schema you've provided. Specifically, we'd be looking at the `FLIGHT` table to get details about the flights, as well as the `CITY` table to ensure we are filtering by the correct city codes for Cincinnati and Tampa. Here's how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI'
    AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'TAMPA'
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Fields**: We're selecting relevant fields from the `FLIGHT` table, such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, `FROM_AIRPORT`, and `TO_AIRPORT`.

2. **Joining Tables**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `CITY` table twice:
   - First to get the `FROM_AIRPORT` information associated with Cincinnati.
   - Second to get the `TO_AIRPORT` information associated with Tampa.

3. **Filtering Conditions**:
   - We check that the `FROM_AIRPORT` city's name matches 'CINCINNATI'.
   - We check that the `TO_AIRPORT` city's name matches 'TAMPA'.
   - We filter the flights to only include those where the hour of `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before 12 (noon). Depending on your SQL dialect, the syntax to extract the hour may vary. The example assumes standard SQL.

Make sure to adjust the query depending on any specific SQL dialect you are using, especially the `HOUR` function, as different database systems may have different methods for extracting parts of a timestamp.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Houston (HOU) to Dallas (DAL) that arrive before midnight (0:00 or 24:00) on a given day, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you want to filter by `ARRIVAL_TIME`:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    AIRPORT_2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME

    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_2 ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_2.AIRPORT_CODE

    AIRPORT.CITY_CODE = 'HOUSTON' AND 
    AIRPORT_2.CITY_CODE = 'DALLAS' AND 
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME < '00:00:00';
```

### Notes:
1. In the SQL script above, adjust `CITY_CODE` in the `WHERE` clause to match your actual implementation if different codes or specific identifiers are used for cities in your database schema.
2. This SQL query assumes that `ARRIVAL_TIME` is stored in a format that is comparable to a time string (like 'HH:MM:SS').
3. Depending on how you represent "Houston" and "Dallas", you may need to properly correlate them with the `CITY` table if required.
4. Ensure the correct format for the `DATETIME` or `TIME` type for comparisons, especially if additional date filtering is required (to ensure you filter on the intended day).

Question: list the flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS that leave before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
The SQL query to list the flights from Indianapolis to Memphis that leave before 12:00 PM (noon) would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    orig.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    dest.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT orig ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = orig.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT dest ON f.TO_AIRPORT = dest.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    orig.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS')
    AND dest.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS')
    AND CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT clause**: This specifies which columns to retrieve: flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline name, and airport names for both origin and destination.
   
2. **FROM clause**: The main table is the `FLIGHT` table, and it is joined with the `AIRLINE` and `AIRPORT` tables to get relevant details.

3. **JOINs**: 
   - Join the `AIRLINE` table on the airline code from the flight.
   - Join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Indianapolis) and once for the destination airport (Memphis).

4. **WHERE clause**: 
   - Filters for flights leaving from Indianapolis to Memphis by checking city codes.
   - Filters for flights that depart before noon using the `CAST` function to convert `DEPARTURE_TIME` to time format and compare it with '12:00:00'.

Make sure to adjust the column names and data types as per your actual database schema if there are any discrepancies.

Question: show me all direct flights from SAN FRANCISCO to BOSTON departing before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.CONNECTIONS = connections0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all direct flights from San Francisco to Boston that depart before 12:00 PM, you will need to join the relevant tables based on the relationships defined in the schema. Specifically, you'll need to use the `FLIGHT` table for flight information and the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for San Francisco and Boston.

Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'
    AND F.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming STOPS = 0 indicates direct flights
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting relevant flight details from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the departure airport (San Francisco) and once for the destination airport (Boston).
- We filter the results to only include flights departing from San Francisco to Boston.
- We ensure the departure time is before 12:00 PM.
- The clause `F.STOPS = 0` is used to ensure we only get direct flights (if the schema indicates that stops are counted this way).

Make sure to adjust the exact field names or logic in the query according to your actual schema and requirements if they differ.

Question: flights from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE arriving between 1600 and 1700
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Pittsburgh to Baltimore that arrive between 16:00 and 17:00 (4:00 PM and 5:00 PM), you will need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the relevant airport information. You will also need to filter based on the arrival time.

Assuming:
- The airport code for Pittsburgh is "PIT"
- The airport code for Baltimore is "BWI"

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT'
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BWI'
    AND CAST(F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We're selecting relevant fields to display.
- **FROM**: We're querying from the `FLIGHT` table, aliased as `F`.
- **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the origin airport (Pittsburgh) and once for the destination airport (Baltimore).
- **WHERE**: The filters are applied to ensure we only get flights from PIT to BWI that arrive between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM.
- **CAST(F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME)**: This ensures the comparison is done correctly if `ARRIVAL_TIME` includes both date and time. If `ARRIVAL_TIME` is already in a time-compatible format, this cast may not be necessary. Adjust based on your database schema. 

Make sure to substitute 'PIT' and 'BWI' with the actual airport codes if they differ.

Question: i want to arrive in DETROIT around 6pm and i'm leaving from CHICAGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Chicago to Detroit that arrive around 6 PM, you would typically query the relevant tables, focusing on details like the departure and arrival times. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this task, assuming you want to capture a range that is considered "around 6 PM." For this case, let's define "around 6 PM" as between 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM.

Here is a draft SQL query for your requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
AND 
    a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DETROIT')
AND 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '18:30:00'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: This clause retrieves the necessary details, including flight number, airline code, times, and airport names.
2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT` which contains the flight details.
3. **JOINs**:
   - The first `JOIN` connects to the `AIRPORT` table to get the name of the departure airport (Chicago).
   - The second `JOIN` connects to the `AIRPORT` table again to get the name of the arrival airport (Detroit).
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - The first two conditions filter flights to only those departing from Chicago and arriving in Detroit.
   - The third condition filters results to include only those flights that arrive between 6:00 PM and 6:30 PM.
5. **ORDER BY Clause**: It orders the result set by the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

Make sure to adjust the time format in the `BETWEEN` clause to match the format stored in your database if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights that are arriving in Baltimore around noon from Denver, you need to query the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables, filtering based on the departure airport (Denver) and the arrival airport (Baltimore). Additionally, you will want to specify a time frame around noon, for example, between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM.

Here is the SQL query that can be used to find such flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'BWI'  -- Baltimore/Washington International Airport code
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'  -- Denver International Airport code
    AND CAST(f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '11:30:00' AND '12:30:00'; 
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT f**: We are selecting from the `FLIGHT` table and its alias is `f`.
2. **FLIGHT_STOP fs**: We are joining the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to access arrival details.
3. **Conditions**:
   - The `STOP_AIRPORT` is filtered to include only flights that arrive at Baltimore's airport, which is typically coded as 'BWI' (please use the correct code if different).
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` is filtered to include only those flights departing from Denver with the airport code 'DEN'.
   - The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is checked to ensure it's within the range of 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.

Make sure to replace 'BWI' and 'DEN' with the appropriate airport codes if different in your dataset.

Question: what are my choices of flights to get from CHARLOTTE to MINNEAPOLIS arriving about 7pm in MINNEAPOLIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MINNEAPOLIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Charlotte to Minneapolis arriving around 7 PM, you will need to join relevant tables and apply appropriate filters. Here's a SQL query to obtain that information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHTS.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE FLIGHTS ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = FLIGHTS.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Charlotte' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Minneapolis'
    AND CAST(F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '18:30:00' AND '19:30:00'  -- Filtering for arrival time around 7 PM
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Columns**: We select the flight number, airport names, departure and arrival times, airline code and name, number of stops, and elapsed time.
   
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Charlotte) and once for the arrival airport (Minneapolis).
   - We also join with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline's name associated with each flight.

3. **Where Clause**:
   - We filter the results to include flights only departing from 'Charlotte' and arriving at 'Minneapolis'.
   - The arrival time is filtered to include flights arriving between 6:30 PM and 7:30 PM using the `CAST` function to ensure we're working with the correct time format.

4. **Ordering Results**: Finally, we sort the results by arrival time for easier reading.

### Note:
Make sure that the names of the airports match those in your `AIRPORT` table and that the correct coding is in place for filtering times (such as considering the time zone if necessary). Adjust the query accordingly if there are discrepancies in naming conventions or data types in your schema.

Question: flights from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE arriving between 1600 and 1700
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Pittsburgh to Baltimore that arrive between 16:00 (4 PM) and 17:00 (5 PM), you would need to join several tables to filter the data appropriately. Specifically, you need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for Pittsburgh and Baltimore, as well as any necessary conversions for time formats. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND CAST(f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT statement**: This specifies the columns we want to retrieve — such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the names of both airports.
2. **FROM clause**: The query mainly works off the `FLIGHT` table.
3. **JOINs**: 
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `a1` for the departure airport/Pittsburgh and `a2` for the arrival airport/Baltimore) on the airport codes.
4. **WHERE clause**: 
   - Here, we filter the results to flights departing from Pittsburgh and arriving in Baltimore, checking that the arrival time falls within the specified range.
5. **Time casting**: Depending on your SQL flavor (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server), you might need to adjust how you deal with time formatting (e.g. using `CAST`).

Make sure that the time format used in the WHERE clause matches the format of the `ARRIVAL_TIME` field in your database. Adjust any date or timezone discrepancies as necessary based on your specific database settings.

Question: okay i'm sorry could you tell me what flights leave ATLANTA and arrive in PHILADELPHIA around 5 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query flights that leave from Atlanta and arrive in Philadelphia around 5 o'clock, we first need to identify the appropriate airport codes for Atlanta and Philadelphia. Assuming the airport codes are as follows:

- Atlanta: ATL
- Philadelphia: PHL

You also need to define what "around 5 o'clock" means in terms of a time range. For example, we can consider flights that leave between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM.

Here is an SQL query that retrieves the relevant flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID, 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND 
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHL' AND 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

This query lists all flights that depart from ATL (Atlanta) to PHL (Philadelphia) and have a departure time between 5:00 PM and 5:59 PM. Adjust the time range as needed based on what "around 5 o'clock" specifically means for your requirements. 

Make sure that the time format used in the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field is compatible with the format used in the SQL query.

Question: is there a flight from PITTSBURGH to BALTIMORE that arrives between 1800 and 1900
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a flight from Pittsburgh to Baltimore that arrives between 18:00 and 19:00 (6:00 PM and 7:00 PM), you can write an SQL query that joins necessary tables based on the given database schema. 

Your SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID, 
       f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       f.FROM_AIRPORT, 
       f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
  AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
  AND CAST(f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '19:00:00';
```

### Explanation:

1. **Selecting Fields**: The query selects relevant fields for identification (like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, etc.).

2. **Joining Tables**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for Pittsburgh (departure) and once for Baltimore (arrival).

3. **Conditions**:
   - It checks that the departure airport is Pittsburgh and the arrival airport is Baltimore.
   - It filters the arrival time to ensure it falls between 18:00 and 19:00. The `CAST` function converts the arrival time to a time type to ensure a proper comparison. Adjust this part of the query if `ARRIVAL_TIME` is not stored as a time type.

Make sure to adjust the airport names according to how they are recorded in the `AIRPORT` table (e.g., you might need to use their airport codes or ensure the names match).

Question: i would like one flight from KANSAS CITY to ST. PAUL arriving around dinnertime 6pm
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Kansas City to St. Paul arriving around dinnertime (around 6 PM), you should join the relevant tables and apply the filtering criteria for the departure and arrival times. 

Here’s the SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PAUL' 
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:30:00' AND '18:30:00';  -- Adjusting 30 minutes before and after 6 PM
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting relevant fields from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables.
- The `JOIN` operations link the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` and `CITY` to filter the flights based on the originating and destination cities.
- The `WHERE` clause includes filters for the departing city (Kansas City) and the arriving city (St. Paul).
- The `ARRIVAL_TIME` filter is set to capture flights arriving between 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM to account for flights arriving "around" dinnertime.

You can adjust the exact time range as needed if you have a different definition of "around dinnertime."

Question: how can i get from INDIANAPOLIS to MONTREAL in the evening
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Indianapolis to Montreal in the evening, you would likely start by querying the `FLIGHT` table to get all flights between these two cities and then filter by the evening departure times. In the context of database queries, "evening" is typically considered to be between 6 PM (18:00) and 11:59 PM (23:59).

You will also need to join a couple of tables to obtain the airport codes and ensure you're retrieving relevant details about the flights, such as the airport information for both cities.

Here’s an example SQL query to get the desired result:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL')
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 18
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 24
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Fields**: The query selects relevant flight details such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
  
2. **Joins**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports based on their codes.

3. **Subqueries**: The query uses subqueries to find the `CITY_CODE` for both Indianapolis and Montreal based on their names.

4. **Filtering by Time**: The `EXTRACT` function is used to filter flights that depart in the evening hours (from 18:00 onwards but before midnight).

5. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` to list flights in sequential order based on their departure times.

Make adjustments as needed to fit your database's SQL dialect, as function names and syntax may vary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Kansas City to Los Angeles that arrives in Los Angeles in the late afternoon, you would need to consider what "late afternoon" means (typically 3 PM to 6 PM). Below is a sample SQL query assuming you have the appropriate structure in your database:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES')
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 15 AND 17  -- 3 PM to 6 PM
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight details such as flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and airport names.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Kansas City) and once for the arrival airport (Los Angeles).
- It filters the flights by checking that the arrival airport corresponds to Los Angeles and the departure airport corresponds to Kansas City.
- The arrival time is filtered to fall within the range of 3 PM to 6 PM using `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.ARRIVAL_TIME)`.
- Finally, the results are ordered by the arrival time.

Make sure to adapt the city names in the subqueries to match those in your `CITY` table and adjust the time conditions as necessary depending on the format of `ARRIVAL_TIME` in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Boston to San Francisco that arrive in the afternoon, you can use the following SQL query. For this query, we will assume that "afternoon" is defined as any arrival time between 12:00 PM (noon) and 5:59 PM (inclusive). 

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND CAST(F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights that depart from Boston and arrive in San Francisco.
- The condition on `ARRIVAL_TIME` ensures that we only include flights that arrive in the afternoon. 

Make sure to adapt the column names in the `FLIGHT` table and `AIRPORT` table as per your actual database schema if they are different.

Question: show me the flights from ST. PETERSBURG to TORONTO that arrive early in the morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from ST. PETERSBURG to TORONTO that arrive early in the morning, we’ll need to join the relevant tables and apply the necessary filters. Assuming early morning flights are defined as arriving between 12:00 AM and 9:00 AM, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PETERSBURG' AND
    A2.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' AND
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting flight details from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the name of the departure airport for ST. PETERSBURG and once for the arrival airport for TORONTO.
- The WHERE clause filters the flights to ensure we are only considering those that depart from ST. PETERSBURG and arrive in TORONTO, and we only include flights that arrive between 12:00 AM and 9:00 AM. 

Make sure to adjust the time format if your database uses a different time format or if the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is stored as a different datatype.

Question: please find me a flight between BOSTON and PHILADELPHIA that arrives in PHILADELPHIA close to 5pm
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight between Boston and Philadelphia that arrives close to 5 PM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that the relevant airport codes for Boston and Philadelphia are identified, and that the times stored in the `FLIGHT` table are in a 24-hour format:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '16:30:00' -- 4:30 PM or later
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME <= '17:30:00' -- 5:30 PM or earlier
ORDER BY 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. We select the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the names of the airports for both the departure and arrival locations.
2. We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
3. We filter the results to only include flights that depart from Boston and arrive in Philadelphia.
4. We specify a time range for the arrival time to capture flights that arrive close to 5 PM.
5. Finally, we order the results by the arrival time.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace the airport names with the correct representations as they appear in your database if they are coded differently.
- The times are assumed to be in a basic 24-hour format based on common database practices, confirm the exact format as necessary.

Question: now i need another flight from LAS VEGAS to LOS ANGELES arriving also in the late afternoon what 's available for that
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve available flights from Las Vegas (LAS) to Los Angeles (LAX) that arrive in the late afternoon, you can use SQL to select the relevant data from the `FLIGHT` table, making sure to filter flights based on the departure and arrival times.

Assuming "late afternoon" means between 4 PM and 6 PM (16:00 to 18:00), the SQL query would typically look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.STOPS, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LAS' AND  -- Las Vegas
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LAX' AND  -- Los Angeles
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= 16 AND  -- Arrival between 4 PM and 6 PM
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.ARRIVAL_TIME) < 18;
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects the flight ID, flight number, arrival time, departure time, airline code, and names of the departure and destination airports.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get airport names for readability.
- It filters flights based on:
  - The departure airport being LAS (Las Vegas).
  - The destination airport being LAX (Los Angeles).
  - Arrivals occurring between 4 PM (16:00) and before 6 PM (18:00).

Make sure to adjust the `EXTRACT` function according to the SQL dialect of your database management system (DBMS) if necessary, as handling dates and times might differ slightly between platforms like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle. If the `ARRIVAL_TIME` and `DEPARTURE_TIME` fields are stored as `TIMESTAMP` or `DATETIME` types, the extraction should work smoothly.

Question: show flights from DENVER to OAKLAND arriving between 0 and 100 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver to Oakland arriving between 0 and 100 o'clock, you would need to query the `FLIGHT` table, most likely filtering on the `FROM_AIRPORT`, `TO_AIRPORT`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME` fields. However, since "0 and 100 o'clock" could denote a 24-hour clock format or may contain a misunderstanding regarding the time range, I assume you mean to filter for arrivals at any time on the same day.

Here's a sample SQL query that fulfills your request while addressing the specified requirements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' -- Replace 'DEN' with the appropriate airport code for Denver
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'OAK' -- Replace 'OAK' with the appropriate airport code for Oakland
  AND ARRIVAL_TIME >= '00:00:00' -- This includes all times after midnight
  AND ARRIVAL_TIME < '24:00:00'; -- This excludes times beyond midnight of the next day
```

Make sure to replace `'DEN'` and `'OAK'` with the actual airport codes for Denver International Airport and Oakland International Airport if they differ. Since the specified arrival time range encompasses all times within a single day, the condition `ARRIVAL_TIME < '24:00:00'` effectively includes all valid flight arrival times.

Question: i would like a flight from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS arrive DALLAS about 12 noon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To write an SQL query that retrieves flights from Philadelphia to Dallas arriving around noon (12:00 PM), you would need to consider the relevant tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_STOP` if you want to consider layovers. The query must filter results for flights originating from Philadelphia and arriving at Dallas, and you will want to ensure that the arrival time is near 12:00 PM.

Here’s a sample SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS')
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '12:59:59'
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: This section specifies the `FLIGHT` table and joins to the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
   
2. **SELECT Clause**: This lists the columns we want to retrieve, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and names of the departure and arrival airports.

3. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results:
   - Looks for flights departing from Philadelphia (`FROM_AIRPORT` derived from the `CITY` table).
   - Looks for flights arriving in Dallas (`TO_AIRPORT` derived from the `CITY` table).
   - Checks that the arrival time is between 12:00 PM and 12:59 PM.

4. **ORDER BY Clause**: This sorts the results by arrival time, so you see the earliest flights around noon first.

### Notes:
- Make sure to replace `CITY_CODE` and other conditions with your actual identifiers if they differ.
- For more precise filtering, you may adjust the time range if you need to account for delays or other factors.
- If you have Date/Time information stored in a different format or if you need to account for time zones, you might need to incorporate additional logic.

Question: show me flights arriving in BALTIMORE from PITTSBURGH between 1600 and 1700
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights arriving in Baltimore from Pittsburgh that fall between the specified time of 16:00 and 17:00, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables to filter flights based on the arrival conditions.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PITTSBURGH'
    AND TIME(f.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= '16:00:00' 
    AND TIME(f.ARRIVAL_TIME) < '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Chooses specific columns to retrieve, including flight details.
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the source of the data.
- **WHERE**: Contains the conditions to filter the results:
  - `f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BALTIMORE'`: Ensures the flight is arriving in Baltimore.
  - `f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PITTSBURGH'`: Ensures the flight is departing from Pittsburgh.
  - `TIME(f.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= '16:00:00' AND TIME(f.ARRIVAL_TIME) < '17:00:00'`: Filters the arrival times to be between 16:00 and 17:00.

Make sure that the names of the airports in the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns match exactly with those stored in the database for the query to execute successfully. If there are airport codes instead of city names in your `FLIGHT` table, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.

Question: show flights from DENVER to OAKLAND arriving between 0 and 100 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver (DEN) to Oakland (OAK) arriving between 0:00 and 100:00 (which seems to be a representation of hours, likely meaning the next day at 04:00 AM), we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'OAK' 
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= 0 
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME) < 10;
```

In this SQL:

- We're selecting relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `FROM_AIRPORT` is filtered to 'DEN' (Denver) and `TO_AIRPORT` to 'OAK' (Oakland).
- The arrival time is filtered to check if the hour is between 0 and 9 inclusive. 

Note: The hour extraction method may differ depending on your SQL database (for instance, `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ...)` is standard SQL), and parts of the `ARRIVAL_TIME` format may need to be adjusted based on how times are stored in your database. Adjust the SQL syntax accordingly based on your specific SQL implementation details (like Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights arriving in Atlanta (ATL) from Boston (BOS) between 16:00 (4:00 PM) and 20:00 (8:00 PM), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BOS' -- Boston
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ATL' -- Atlanta
    AND TIME(ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '20:00:00';
```

**Explanation:**
- The query selects several fields from the `FLIGHT` table that are necessary to identify the flights.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to filter by the originating airport (Boston) and the destination airport (Atlanta).
- The `WHERE` clause checks for the arrival airport, the departure airport, and filters the arrival time to include only those flights arriving between 16:00 and 20:00.

Question: show me the flights arriving in BALTIMORE from PHILADELPHIA at about 4 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights arriving in Baltimore from Philadelphia around 4 o'clock, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that "4 o'clock" could refer to a time range around 4:00 PM, including a buffer of a few minutes before and after:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BALTIMORE'
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '16:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT` clause selects the relevant columns for clarity.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the `FLIGHT` table from which to retrieve the data.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results:
  - It checks that the `FROM_AIRPORT` is 'PHILADELPHIA' and that the `TO_AIRPORT` is 'BALTIMORE'.
  - It also checks that `ARRIVAL_TIME` is within the range from 4:00 PM to 4:59 PM.

Make sure the time format in the query matches your database schema's format for `ARRIVAL_TIME`. Adjust accordingly if it's stored differently.

Question: could you tell me about flights from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS that arrives in the early afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Philadelphia to Dallas that arrive in the early afternoon, you will likely need to join several tables in the database schema. Specifically, you'll need to work with the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly the `CITY` tables to get the relevant data.

Given that "early afternoon" could be defined as around 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, we can formulate the SQL query accordingly. Here’s an example SQL query that retrieves such flights.

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FS.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects relevant columns that show the flight information, including flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
2. **JOIN Clauses**: Links the necessary tables together:
    - `FLIGHT` to `FLIGHT_STOP` to get both flight and stop details.
    - Joins `AIRPORT` tables to translate airport codes into names.
    - Joins `CITY` tables to filter for specific cities.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to include only flights from Philadelphia to Dallas, and specifically looks for flights arriving between 12 PM and 3 PM.

### Note:
- Depending on the specific SQL dialect used, you may need to adjust the function or syntax used to extract the hour from the arrival time (e.g., using `EXTRACT` or `DATE_PART` in some SQL dialects).
- Ensure to test the query in your SQL environment for compatibility and correctness.

Question: what round trip flights between ATLANTA and DENVER qualify for fare code QX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "QX" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find round trip flights between Atlanta (ATL) and Denver (DEN) that qualify for fare code QX, we need to join the relevant tables together. The tables involved will be `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` to connect flights to their fares. The `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` in the `FARE` table need to match the airports for Atlanta and Denver.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    ff.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'QX' 
    AND fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
    AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM FLIGHT f2 
        JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID 
        JOIN FARE fare2 ON ff2.FARE_ID = fare2.FARE_ID
        WHERE 
            fare2.FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'QX' 
            AND fare2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
            AND fare2.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
            AND f.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE  -- Ensure the round trip is with the same airline
    );
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Necessary Fields**: We select IDs, flight numbers, airline codes, departure, and arrival times for the relevant flights along with fare details.

2. **Joining Tables**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the information related to fares corresponding to each flight.

3. **Filtering Conditions in WHERE Clause**:
   - We filter for fare code QX.
   - We specify that one leg of the fare must go from Atlanta (ATL) to Denver (DEN).

4. **EXISTS Clause for Round Trip**:
   - To ensure we get round trip flights, we check if there exists a flight from Denver (DEN) back to Atlanta (ATL) with the same fare code QX.
   - This check also ensures that the round trip is with the same airline, maintaining consistency in the query.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with the exact column names as per your real database if they vary.

Question: show me the fares from WASHINGTON to OAKLAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from WASHINGTON to OAKLAND, you will need to join several tables based on the provided schema. Notably, you will need to use the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables to find the relevant airport codes corresponding to these cities. Here's a SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.FARE_AIRLINE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY from_city ON from_airport.CITY_CODE = from_city.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY to_city ON to_airport.CITY_CODE = to_city.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    from_city.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'
    AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The `FARE` table is used to get the fare details.
- The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice to get both the departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and destination (`TO_AIRPORT`) airport codes.
- The `CITY` table is used to find the corresponding city names for the airports.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies the cities of interest—WASHINGTON and OAKLAND. 

Ensure that the city names match exactly with the values in the database, including considerations for any potential variations in the city names.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of flights from Baltimore to Philadelphia, you will need to query the relevant tables in your database. You'll want to obtain flight IDs that correspond to the flights from Baltimore to Philadelphia and then join this with the fare data to get the costs.

The following SQL query provides an example of how to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **FLIGHT f**: This is the primary table that consists of flight details.
- **JOIN**: The query uses joins to link the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables together.
- **WHERE Clause**: This filters results to only include flights that depart from Baltimore and arrive in Philadelphia.
- **SELECT**: We are selecting flight details including flight number, arrival time, departure time, and costs for one-way and round trip.

Make sure to adjust the airport names based on the actual names in your `AIRPORT` table, as these might include city codes or actual airport codes rather than names directly.

Question: what is the price of flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the price of flights from Indianapolis to Memphis using the provided database schema, we need to perform a query that joins several relevant tables. The primary tables we would use in this scenario are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and possibly the `AIRPORT` table to map the city names to airport codes. 

Assuming the airport codes for Indianapolis (IND) and Memphis (MEM) are already determined, here's an SQL query that can be used:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS');
```

This query does the following:
1. Selects the flight number, airline code, one-way cost, and round-trip cost.
2. Joins the `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables to correlate flights with their fare information.
3. Filters the results to include only those flights from Indianapolis to Memphis by looking up the respective airport codes.

Please adjust the airport names in the subqueries if the actual airport names in your database differ from those used in the query. Additionally, if the actual airport codes are known (e.g., `IND` for Indianapolis and `MEM` for Memphis), you could directly use them in the query instead of subqueries.

Question: what is the fare for flights from DENVER to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the fare for flights from Denver to Atlanta using the provided database schema, you will need to join several tables, including `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT`. In this query, we will assume that the airport codes for Denver and Atlanta are known (for example, `DEN` for Denver International Airport and `ATL` for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport). You would also want to find the fare based on the specific route.

Here's a SQL query to retrieve the fare information for flights from Denver to Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver International Airport' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport';
```

Note:
1. Ensure that you replace 'Denver International Airport' and 'Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport' with the correct airport names or codes if needed.
2. Adjust the column selections and the join conditions based on the actual relationships in your database.
3. The query assumes that `FARE_ID` in the `FARE` table relates to `FLIGHT_ID` in the `FLIGHT` table. If this is not the case, make sure to adjust the query accordingly.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,

FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: price of flight from CLEVELAND to NASHVILLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the price of a flight from Cleveland to Nashville, you need to join several tables that store relevant flight and fare information based on the provided database schema. Here is an SQL query that retrieves the price of flights from Cleveland to Nashville:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NASHVILLE';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM clause**: You're starting from the `FLIGHT` table, as it contains information about flights, including departure and arrival airports.
2. **JOIN statements**: 
   - You're joining the `AIRPORT` table twice to get information for both the origin (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and the destination (`TO_AIRPORT`) of flights.
   - You're also joining the `FARE` table to get fare information for the flights.
3. **WHERE clause**: This restricts the results to flights where the departure airport matches Cleveland and the arrival airport matches Nashville.
4. **SELECT statement**: It selects the desired columns from the joined tables, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, along with the fare costs. 

### Note:
Make sure the airport names match the data in the `AIRPORT` table. You may want to verify the correct airport codes for Cleveland and Nashville if there are multiple airports or aliases for these cities.

Question: what 's the fare from WASHINGTON to BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fare from Washington to Boston based on the provided database schema, you'll need to join several tables to access both the airports and the fare information. Assuming the airport codes for Washington and Boston are known (for example, WDC for Washington and BOS for Boston), the SQL query can look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%BOSTON%';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: We select the fare ID and the costs (one-way and round-trip).
2. **FROM FARE f**: We start from the FARE table, aliased as `f`.
3. **JOIN**: We join the FARE table with the AIRPORT table twice:
   - First, to get the airport information for the departure airport (Washington).
   - Second, to get the airport information for the arrival airport (Boston).
4. **WHERE**: We filter the results to include only those fares departing from a Washington airport and arriving at a Boston airport.

### Important Notes:
- Make sure to replace the placeholders (`WDC` and `BOS`) with the actual airport codes or names as needed.
- The `LIKE` operator is used here to accommodate variations in the naming of the airports.
- Depending on the actual airport names and codes used in your schema, adjust the query accordingly.

Question: okay can you tell me the flight cost between DENVER and ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flight cost between Denver (Airport Code: DEN) and Atlanta (Airport Code: ATL), you would need to join relevant tables to extract the necessary information. The primary tables you'll need to consider are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`, among others.

Here's an SQL query that retrieves the flight costs between Denver and Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT**: Choosing specific columns to display, namely the flight number, departure and arrival times, and the one-way and round-trip costs.
2. **FROM FLIGHT F**: Starting from the `FLIGHT` table and giving it an alias `F`.
3. **JOIN**: Joining the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the price information associated with each flight.
4. **WHERE**: Filtering the results to include only flights that depart from Denver and arrive at Atlanta.

Ensure that the airport codes ('DEN' for Denver and 'ATL' for Atlanta) match what you have in your database. Adjust the query as needed if there are multiple connections or if additional conditions apply.

Question: what is the cost of a flight from BOSTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a flight from Boston to Denver, we'll need to join several tables to get the necessary information, including flights, fares, and airports. Since a flight might involve multiple airlines and fare options, we'll focus on getting the distinct costs.

We'll first identify the airport codes for Boston and Denver, then retrieve the flights between those two cities and their associated fare information.

Here’s the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT a_from
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN'  -- Assuming 'DEN' is the airport code for Denver
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE AND f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BOS'  -- Assuming 'BOS' is the airport code for Boston
```

In this query:
1. We select the flight number, airline code, and fare costs.
2. We join the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for Boston and Denver.
3. We join the `FLIGHT` table to find flights departing from Boston to Denver.
4. We join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get the corresponding fare details.

Make sure to replace 'DEN' and 'BOS' with the actual airport codes for Denver and Boston if they are different in your database schema. Additionally, you can add more details to the SELECT clause or WHERE clause based on your needs.

Question: please show me all fares for flights from DENVER to OAKLAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all fares for flights from Denver to Oakland, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. The main tables involved in this query include the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables.

1. First, you need to identify the airport codes for Denver and Oakland from the `AIRPORT` table.
2. Then, you will filter the `FLIGHT` table for flights that originate from Denver (the corresponding airport code) and land in Oakland (the respective airport code).
3. Lastly, you join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare details for those flights.

Below is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FA.FARE_ID,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FA.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE FARE ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver' AND A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Denver')
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Oakland' AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Oakland');
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Specifies that we are selecting from the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as F).
- `JOIN FARE FARE`: Joins the `FARE` table on the condition that the `FLIGHT_ID` matches.
- `JOIN AIRPORT A1`: Joins on the originating airport (Denver).
- `JOIN AIRPORT A2`: Joins on the destination airport (Oakland).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for the specific cities Denver and Oakland using their respective airport codes.
  
Make sure that the city names and airport names match correctly with the data in your database, as they are case sensitive and should be precise.

Question: show me fares from MIAMI to NEW YORK
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To show fares from Miami to New York, you'll need to write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables like `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and perhaps `CITY` to filter by the specific airports in those cities. Here’s a possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Miami%' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%New York%';
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting the columns from the `FARE` table that we are interested in (FARE_ID, fare basis, airline, costs).
- The `JOIN` clauses are used to connect the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table, once for the departure airport (Miami) and once for the arrival airport (New York).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to show only fares from airports in Miami to airports in New York. The `LIKE` operator is used to ensure we can find variations in naming, e.g., "Miami International Airport" or simply "New York". 

Make sure to replace `%Miami%` and `%New York%` with the actual airport names contained in your database, if you have those specific code values or names.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Denver to San Francisco, you will likely need to join multiple tables, particularly the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables to correctly associate the airports with the respective cities. Here’s how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'  -- Ensure you reference the correct column for location
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SAN FRANCISCO'; -- Ensure you reference the correct column for location
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Fields**: The query selects the relevant fare information and airport names.
2. **Joins**: It joins the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Denver) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
3. **Where Clause**: The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions to filter results to show only fares that go from Denver to San Francisco.

Make sure to adjust the conditions in the `WHERE` clause to match how the airport locations are stored in your database schema, as it may vary depending on how addresses are structured. For instance, if you have a specific column that defines the city or general location, you should adapt the query accordingly.

Question: show me prices of flights from BALTIMORE to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of flights from Baltimore to Dallas, you need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you will need to join the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially other related tables to get the required information. Below is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    Fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    Fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE Fare ON FF.FARE_ID = Fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- **SELECT**: Defines which columns should be returned. We are selecting the flight number, airline code, the names of the departure and destination airports, and the one-way and round-trip fares.

- **FROM FLIGHT F**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table, aliased as `F`.

- **JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport name for the starting airport (Baltimore).

- **JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE**: Joins again on the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport name for the destination airport (Dallas).

- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID**: Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to connect flights with their corresponding fare information.

- **JOIN FARE Fare ON FF.FARE_ID = Fare.FARE_ID**: Joins the `FARE` table to access the fare costs.

- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights that depart from Baltimore and arrive in Dallas.

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport names ("BALTIMORE" and "DALLAS") match exactly what is stored in your database. You might need to check the `AIRPORT` table for the exact names or codes used.
- Adjust the query if you want specific fare types or if there are additional conditions (e.g., flight dates or specific airlines).

Question: show me fares from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia based on the provided database schema, you'll want to join the relevant tables that contain information about fares, airports, and cities. 

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.FARE_AIRLINE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM
    FARE f
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    CITY c_from ON a_from.CITY_CODE = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN
    CITY c_to ON a_to.CITY_CODE = c_to.CITY_CODE
WHERE
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND
    c_to.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the fields to retrieve — FARE_ID, FARE_BASIS_CODE, etc.
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts from the FARE table (aliased as `f`).
3. **JOINs**:
   - First join on the `AIRPORT` table (`a_from`) to determine the FROM_AIRPORT.
   - Secondly, join again on the `AIRPORT` table (`a_to`) for the TO_AIRPORT.
   - Then join the `CITY` table twice to match both the origin city and destination city.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include fares where the departure city is Baltimore and the destination city is Philadelphia.

Make sure the actual names of cities in the database match exactly with the query (case-sensitive), or you may need to alter the conditions to match how they're stored.

Question: show me fares from BALTIMORE to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia from the given database schema, you'll primarily be interested in the `FARE` table, which contains information about fares between airports. You'll also need to identify the relevant airport codes for Baltimore and Philadelphia from the `AIRPORT` table.

Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.FARE_AIRLINE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: This section retrieves the specific columns of interest in the fare information (fare ID, fare basis code, airline, one-direction cost, round trip cost, and whether a round trip is required).
   
2. **FROM Clause**: The `FARE` table is selected as the primary table to gather fare information.

3. **JOIN Statements**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice — once for the departure city (`BALTIMORE`) and once for the destination city (`PHILADELPHIA`) to filter the results based on the specific airports.

4. **WHERE Clause**: This clause filters the results to only include fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia. 

Make sure to replace `BALTIMORE` and `PHILADELPHIA` with the actual airport names as they appear in your `AIRPORT` table, or use their airport codes if you have those.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Dallas to Baltimore based on the provided database schema, you would need to join the relevant tables that contain information about flights, fare information, and the airports in Dallas and Baltimore. Below is an example of an SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,

    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FARE F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas' AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Baltimore';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FARE` table is selected to get fare information, including costs.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Dallas) and once for the arrival airport (Baltimore).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include fares that are from Dallas to Baltimore, based on their airport names.

Make sure that the airport names are accurately reflected in the actual database, as they might differ (e.g., by using airport codes instead). If you want to filter using airport codes instead, replace `A1.AIRPORT_NAME` and `A2.AIRPORT_NAME` with the respective airport codes for Dallas and Baltimore.

Question: what are the prices of the flights from DALLAS to BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of flights from Dallas to Baltimore, we first need to identify the specific airport codes for Dallas and Baltimore. We'll use the `AIRPORT` table to get the necessary airport codes for these cities. After obtaining the airport codes, we can join the relevant tables to fetch the flight prices.

Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED, 
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE FARE_A 
    ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FARE_A.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM 
    ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO 
    ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas' -- You may need to adjust this to match the actual name used in the database
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Baltimore'; -- Same as above
```

Here's a breakdown of how the query works:
1. The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FARE` table using the `FLIGHT_ID`.
2. The `FROM_AIRPORT` is linked to the `AIRPORT` table to find the airport code for Dallas, and `TO_AIRPORT` is linked to find the airport code for Baltimore.
3. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights departing from Dallas (replace 'Dallas' if a specific airport name is needed) and arriving at Baltimore (replace 'Baltimore' similarly).
4. The final selection pulls relevant details about the flight along with the pricing information.

Make sure to verify the airport names used in the query with the actual data in the database if necessary.

SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of all flights from Atlanta to Washington, you'll typically need to join several tables to get the necessary information, including flights and fare details. Below is an SQL query that demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT Table (F)**: Capture flight details such as flight numbers and times.
2. **FARE_FARE Table (FF)**: Link flights to their corresponding fares.
3. **FARE Table (FA)**: Get pricing information for flights.
4. **AIRPORT Table (A1 and A2)**: Identify the relevant airports based on names for departure and arrival.
5. **WHERE Clause**: Filter for flights specifically from 'ATLANTA' to 'WASHINGTON'.

### Note:
- Ensure that airport names ('ATLANTA' and 'WASHINGTON') match exactly how they are recorded in the `AIRPORT` table. If the airport codes or names differ, adjustments in the query will be necessary.
- You may need to consider the specific airport codes for Atlanta (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and Washington (could refer to either Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport or Washington Dulles International Airport) in your filtering logic.
- Depending on the database and schema implementation you work with, modifications might be needed.

Question: i need fare information from DENVER to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get fare information from Denver to Pittsburgh using the provided database schema, you will need to join the relevant tables: `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and potentially others, depending on which specifics you want (e.g., flight details, fare basis, etc.). 

Assuming that we are only interested in basic fare information such as the fare cost without additional complexities (like restrictions), your SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    FA.BOOKING_CLASS, 
    FA.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PITTSBURGH';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects fare IDs, airports, and fare costs (one-way and round trip).
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - The `FARE` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice:
     - `A_FROM` for the departure airport (Denver).
     - `A_TO` for the destination airport (Pittsburgh).
3. **Where Clause**: The conditions ensure that you're filtering for flights starting from Denver and arriving in Pittsburgh.

### Note:
Make sure that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` column contains the correct entries for 'DENVER' and 'PITTSBURGH', as this may vary depending on how data is stored in the database. Adjust the column names in the `WHERE` clause accordingly if necessary.

Question: please give me fares from DENVER to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Denver to Philadelphia, you would typically need to find the relevant airport codes for these cities, look up the fares associated with flights between those two airports, and then join the necessary tables to get the required information. Assuming you have the airport codes for Denver (DEN) and Philadelphia (PHL), the SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,

    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHL';
```

This query selects various fare details from the `FARE` table where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is Denver (DEN) and the `TO_AIRPORT` is Philadelphia (PHL). You might need to adjust the airport codes if they differ in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the airfare between Denver (DEN) and Pittsburgh (PIT), you would typically join several tables to find the fare information associated with flights that connect these two airports. The key tables for this query would include `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and the possible `FLIGHT_FARE` for necessary linking. Here's how you might structure the SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fl.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS src_airport
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON src_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = fare.FROM_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS fl ON fare.FARE_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS dest_airport ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = dest_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    src_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'Denver%')
    AND dest_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'Pittsburgh%');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Columns**: We're interested in the airline code, flight number, one-way cost, round-trip cost, and fare basis code.
  
2. **Joins**:
   - **FARE**: This table contains fare information, linking it with the flights.
   - **FLIGHT**: This table contains flight details and is linked by `FARE_ID`.
   - **AIRPORT**: We use this table to get the appropriate airport codes for Denver and Pittsburgh.

3. **Conditions**: We filter the records by selecting the airport codes for Denver and Pittsburgh. We assumed the names of the airports typically contain 'Denver' and 'Pittsburgh', you may want to adjust this part according to actual airport names in your database.

Make sure to run this query in an SQL-compatible environment, considering potential variations in the actual table content or names in your schema.

Question: how much does it cost to fly from BOSTON to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the cost of flying from Boston to Atlanta, you would need to retrieve the fare information related to flights between these two airports. Given the schema, you would typically need to join multiple tables to get the desired information. Here is a potential SQL query that might help you find the cost:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.Flight_Number, 
    F.Departure_Time, 
    F.Arrival_Time, 
    FARE.One_Direction_Cost,
    FARE.Round_Trip_Cost
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.From_Airport = A1.Airport_Code
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.To_Airport = A2.Airport_Code
JOIN 
    FARE ON F.Flight_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.Airport_Name = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A2.Airport_Name = 'ATLANTA';
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, and fare information (both one-way and round-trip costs).
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the `From_Airport` (Boston) and `To_Airport` (Atlanta).
- It also joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table to get the fare details.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that you are only interested in flights originating from Boston and arriving in Atlanta.

Make sure to replace `A1.Airport_Name` and `A2.Airport_Name` with the correct airport codes if your database uses codes instead of names. You may also need to adjust the table and column names according to the specifics of your database schema if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares between Atlanta and Boston from the provided database schema, we need to identify the airport codes for Atlanta and Boston. Once we have that, we can query the `FARE` table which contains the necessary fare information. We can then use the relevant `FLIGHT` or `FARE` records to get the desired fares.

Here's an example of how you can construct the SQL query to find fares between Atlanta and Boston. This assumes you have already identified `ATL` as the airport code for Atlanta and `BOS` as the airport code for Boston:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.FARE_AIRLINE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    rb.BOOKING_CLASS,
    rb.CLASS_TYPE,
    rb.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS rb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = rb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

- **SELECT Clause:** This specifies the fields you want to retrieve: fare ID, fare basis code, airline, one-direction cost, round trip cost, and the associated booking class details.

- **FROM Clause:** This indicates the main table to query, which is the `FARE` table.

- **JOIN Clause:** A join is performed with the `FARE_BASIS` table to get more details about the fare, specifically the booking class and class description, based on the fare basis code.

- **WHERE Clause:** This specifies the condition to filter results where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is Atlanta (represented by `'ATL'`) and the `TO_AIRPORT` is Boston (represented by `'BOS'`).

Make sure to replace `'ATL'` and `'BOS'` with the actual airport codes if they are different in your dataset. Additionally, you might need to adjust the query based on any other specific requirements or additional constraints specified by your schema not covered here.

Question: how much is a flight from WASHINGTON to BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a flight from Washington to Boston, you will need to join several tables based on the provided schema. Specifically, you will focus on the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly other related tables to filter the data accordingly.

Here is an example SQL query that retrieves the flight fare from Washington to Boston:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%BOSTON%';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: We're starting from the `FLIGHT` table and aliasing it as `f`.
- **JOIN AIRPORT a1**: Joining the `AIRPORT` table to identify the departure airport, aliased as `a1`.
- **JOIN AIRPORT a2**: Joining the `AIRPORT` table again to identify the destination airport, aliased as `a2`.
- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff**: Joining the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to connect flights to their respective fares.
- **JOIN FARE fa**: Joining the `FARE` table to get the fare data, associated with each flight.
- **WHERE clause**: Filtering the results to flights from any airport in Washington to any airport in Boston.

Adjust the `LIKE` clause in the `WHERE` statement according to the specific names used in your `AIRPORT` table for Washington and Boston, as they may differ (e.g., "Washington D.C." or other abbreviations). 

You may also want to include additional conditions (like dates, specific airlines, etc.), depending on your specific needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Dallas to San Francisco, you'll need to link the relevant tables in the database schema. Assuming that the airport codes for Dallas and San Francisco are known, we need to filter the fare records based on the appropriate airport codes.

Here’s an example SQL query that demonstrates how to retrieve fares for flights from Dallas to San Francisco:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'Dallas%' AND   -- Use appropriate filtering for Dallas airports
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'San Francisco%' -- Use appropriate filtering for San Francisco airports
```

### Explanation:

- This query selects the fields you may find useful from the `FARE` table.
- It joins the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Dallas) and once for the destination airport (San Francisco).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to ensure that it only includes fares where the departure airport is from Dallas and the arrival airport is in San Francisco.
- The `LIKE` clause is used to handle cases where there may be several Dallas or San Francisco airports. You can replace `'Dallas%'` and `'San Francisco%'` with specific airport names or codes (e.g., `'DFW'` for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and `'SFO'` for San Francisco International Airport) for more accuracy.

Make sure to modify the conditions in the `WHERE` clause according to the actual airport names or airport codes in your database to get the exact results you need.

Raw LLM Response:
To find out the cost of a flight from Washington to Montreal, we would typically use a SQL query that joins several relevant tables in the database schema. The key tables for this query are `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` depending on how the data is structured.

Here’s a sample SQL query that could be used to find the costs of flights from Washington (searching for both Washington D.C. airports, DCA and IAD) to Montreal (specifically looking for the airport YUL):

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY from_city ON from_airport.CITY_CODE = from_city.CITY_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY to_city ON to_airport.CITY_CODE = to_city.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    from_city.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL';
```

Make sure to replace the necessary fields (like `from_airport` and `to_airport`) based on the exact airport codes pertaining to Washington and Montreal depending on your data. This query assumes you want to see the flight number, airline code, one-way cost, and round-trip cost. 

Also, adapt it according to your specific needs and the actual relationships in your database if they differ from this structure.

Question: what is the cost of a flight from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a flight from Boston to San Francisco, we need to identify the following components in the database schema:

1. **Airports**: We need to determine the airport codes for Boston and San Francisco.
2. **Flights**: We should find flights that utilize these airports.
3. **Fares**: Finally, we can extract fare information related to those flights.

### SQL Query Example

Here is a SQL query that combines these steps to find the cost of flights from Boston to San Francisco:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS COST_ONE_WAY,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS COST_ROUND_TRIP
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS A1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS A2 ON A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco'
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS F ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE AND F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Selecting Data**: The query selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, stops, and costs for one-way and round-trip flights.
2. **Airports Join**: It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for Boston and once for San Francisco, based on their names.
3. **Joining Flights**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table to find flights operating from Boston to San Francisco.
4. **Joining Fares**: It joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve the cost associated with each flight.

### Important Note:
- Ensure that the names 'Boston' and 'San Francisco' match exactly with those in the `AIRPORT` table.
- Price data may also depend on availability, date of travel, and class of service, which could be added to the query if those specifics are known.

Question: what is the cost of flights from DENVER to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of flights from Denver to San Francisco using the database schema you provided, you'll need to join several tables, specifically those that relate flights, fares, and airports. Here's a SQL query that will accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, and the costs associated with the flight (one-way and round-trip costs) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It performs a join with the `FARE` table using the `FLIGHT_ID` to match corresponding flights with their fare information.
- Additionally, it joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to filter for flights originating from Denver and going to San Francisco.
- Finally, the `WHERE` clause specifies the airport names to filter the results accordingly.

Please ensure that the `AIRPORT` table actually contains 'DENVER' and 'SAN FRANCISCO' as `AIRPORT_NAME` entries and adjust them if needed, as airports may be identified by their code or provide alternative names in different datasets.

Question: what is the airfare from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the airfare from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA, you would first need to identify the relevant airports for both cities, which would then allow you to look up the corresponding fares. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this by joining the necessary tables:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    R.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    AIRPORT A1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    FARE F ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = F.TO_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS S1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = S1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON S1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE AS S2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = S2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON S2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
LEFT JOIN 
    RESTRICTION R ON F.RESTRICTION_CODE = R.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA';
```

This query does the following:
1. Selects relevant fields from the `FARE` table, which contains airfare information.
2. Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for Pittsburgh and once for Atlanta.
3. Joins the `FARE` table where the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` match the respective airport codes.
4. Connects each airport with its city through the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` and `CITY` tables.
5. Optionally retrieves restriction information by joining the `RESTRICTION` table based on the corresponding `RESTRICTION_CODE`.
6. Filters the results to ensure we are looking specifically for the route from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA. 

Make sure to adjust field names in the `SELECT` clause according to the information you need (e.g., adding more fields if necessary), and ensure that you have the relevant airports in the `FARE` data for them to return actual airfare values.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve airfare information from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, you would typically join several tables to get the necessary details like fare amount, airline, etc. Here’s an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Joined**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table contains the flight information, including the airport codes.
   - The `FARE` table provides the fare details associated with the flights.
   - The `AIRLINE` table gives the name of the airline.

2. **Conditions**: 
   - We're filtering for flights that leave from Pittsburgh and arrive in San Francisco. The subqueries find the appropriate airport codes based on the airport names.

3. **Selected Columns**: 
   - The query selects the flight number, airline name, and fare details for one-way and round-trip costs.

### Note: 
Ensure the names of the airports in the query match exactly with what is present in the `AIRPORT` table, as they might differ (e.g., airport name vs airport code may need consideration based on how information is stored). Adjust the query accordingly if there's case sensitivity or different naming conventions used in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of flights from Baltimore to Dallas, you will need to join several tables in the database schema you provided. Specifically, you will need to reference the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables. Below is the SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FARE` table using the `FLIGHT_ID` (assuming `FARE_ID` corresponds to a flight).
- The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice: once for the departure airport (Baltimore) and once for the arrival airport (Dallas).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only flights from BALTIMORE to DALLAS.
- It selects the relevant fields such as flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the prices for one-way and round-trip flights.

Make sure to adjust table and column names if they differ from your schema or if any additional filtering is necessary based on your requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fare information from Dallas to San Francisco, you would typically use a SQL query that joins the relevant tables in your database schema. In this case, you need to look at the `FARE` table to find the fares from the airport in Dallas to the airport in San Francisco. You'll also need to reference the `AIRPORT` table to get the specific airport codes for those cities. 

Here is a SQL query example:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.FARE_AIRLINE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT**: We are selecting fare-related data such as fare ID, fare basis code, airline, one-way cost, and round trip cost, as well as the airport codes.

2. **FROM FARE f**: We are starting from the `FARE` table which contains the fare details.

3. **JOINs**: We're joining the `AIRPORT` table twice:
   - First as `a1` to match the `FROM_AIRPORT` with the airport in Dallas.
   - Second as `a2` to match the `TO_AIRPORT` with the airport in San Francisco.

4. **WHERE clause**: We are filtering records where the `AIRPORT_NAME` equals "Dallas" for the first airport and "San Francisco" for the second airport.

Make sure the values 'Dallas' and 'San Francisco' are consistent with how the airports are named in your `AIRPORT` table, as they might have specific airport names or codes instead. If your airport names are stored in a different format, you should adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly.

Question: show me the air fare for the flights from BALTIMORE to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the air fare for flights from Baltimore to Dallas, we first need to identify the relevant airport codes for each city. Then, we will join the necessary tables to obtain the flight information along with their corresponding fares. Assuming "BALTIMORE" and "DALLAS" are the city names in the CITY table, we will look up their airport codes from the AIRPORT table and then join this with the FLIGHT and FARE tables.

Here's a sample SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS a_from
JOIN 
    CITY AS c_from ON a_from.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS a_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_LOCATION = (
        SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS'
    )
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS f ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE AND f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM AIRPORT AS a_from**: We begin by selecting the `AIRPORT` table as `a_from` to locate the airport code for Baltimore.
2. **JOIN CITY AS c_from**: We join the `CITY` table to find the correct city code for Baltimore.
3. **JOIN AIRPORT AS a_to**: We join again on the `AIRPORT` table to get the destination airport, Dallas, based on its city code.
4. **JOIN FLIGHT AS f**: We use the `FLIGHT` table to find flights departing from Baltimore's airport code to Dallas' airport code.
5. **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS ff**: This join retrieves the fare associated with each flight.
6. **JOIN FARE AS fare**: Finally, we join with the `FARE` table to get the cost details of the flights.

### Note:
Make sure to replace `CITY_CODE` or `AIRPORT_LOCATION` with the appropriate column names if your schema has specific mappings or naming conventions. You may also need to adjust the subquery for obtaining the Dallas airport code depending on how the data is structured in your tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Miami to New York, you first need to identify the airport codes for Miami and New York based on the `AIRPORT` table. Once you have the airport codes, you can use the `FARE` table to get the relevant fares. 

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT F.FARE_ID, 
       F.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
       F.FARE_AIRLINE, 
       F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
       F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
       F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM FARE F
JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Miami' AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'New York';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the columns of interest from the `FARE` table, including fare ID, fare basis code, airline, one-direction cost, round trip cost, and whether a round trip is required.
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates that we are selecting from the `FARE` table.
3. **JOIN Statements**: 
   - The first join links the `FARE` table to the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the departure airport (Miami).
   - The second join connects to the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the destination airport (New York).
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to show only those fares that originate from the airport code associated with Miami and that are headed to the airport code associated with New York.

Note that in practice, the exact airport codes for Miami and New York will need to be provided or interpreted based on the specific airport names or locations as stored in your database. Make sure the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` field corresponds correctly to how cities are stored in your `CITY` or `AIRPORT` tables. If there are multiple airports in Miami or New York, you may need to further refine the criteria based on specific airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the price of a flight from Nashville to Cleveland, you will need to join several tables, particularly the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables. Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,

FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Nashville' AND 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Cleveland';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Columns**: This query selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, along with the one-way and round-trip costs of the fare.
2. **Joining Tables**: The query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the origin and once for the destination) and with the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the price information.
3. **Filter Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause filters the records to get only those flights departing from Nashville to Cleveland.

Make sure to run this query in an environment where the database has been set up according to your provided schema. If the airport names differ (e.g., if you have codes instead), you might need to adjust the filtering conditions accordingly.

Question: show me the price of all flights from ATLANTA to WASHINGTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the prices of all flights from Atlanta to Washington, you need to join the relevant tables based on the relationships depicted in the database schema. The key steps are to identify the airports for Atlanta and Washington, then look for flights connecting those airports, and finally retrieve the fare information linked to those flights.

Here's how you might write the SQL query for this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT a_from
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE AND f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA';
```

### Explanation:
- We first join the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for Atlanta and Washington.
- Next, we join the `FLIGHT` table to find flights originating from Atlanta and arriving in Washington.
- We also join the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to associate flight IDs with fare IDs.
- Finally, we join the `FARE` table to access the fare data, specifically the one-way and round-trip costs for these flights. 

This query assumes that the airport names 'ATLANTA' and 'WASHINGTON' are available in the `AIRPORT` table and that flights exist between these locations, which would typically be the case.

Note: In practice, you should check how the airport names are stored, as sometimes they may include more specific details or abbreviations. Adjust the names in the query accordingly if necessary.

Question: how much does it cost to fly from ATLANTA to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the cost of flying from Atlanta (ATL) to San Francisco (SFO) based on the provided database schema, you'll typically need to join several tables: the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables. This is because you will need to find available flights between the two cities and then associate those flights with their corresponding fares.

Assuming you're also looking for round-trip costs, the following SQL query demonstrates how to retrieve the cost of a flight from Atlanta to San Francisco using the specified schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: The query retrieves the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, one-way cost, and round-trip cost.
  
2. **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table on `FLIGHT_ID`, and then this is joined with the `FARE` table on `FARE_ID` to access cost information.

3. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results to only include flights originating from ATL (Atlanta) to SFO (San Francisco).

You can execute this query in your SQL environment, and it will return the available flights along with their costs. Depending on what you need, you can adjust the `SELECT` statement to include additional fields or modify the `WHERE` clause for filtering.

Question: give me fares from ATLANTA to BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Atlanta to Baltimore using the provided database schema, we need to determine the codes for the airports in those cities. Based on the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables, we can find the `AIRPORT_CODE` for Atlanta and Baltimore. Once we have these airport codes, we can join the relevant tables to get the fare information.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    C.CITY_NAME AS FROM_CITY,
    C2.CITY_NAME AS TO_CITY
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE';
```

In this query:

- We select relevant fields from the `FARE` table and join with the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to match the origin and destination.
- We filter the results for the originating city of Atlanta and the destination of Baltimore.
  
Make sure to replace `AIRPORT_CODE` values appropriately if they differ from mapping in the `CITY` table. 

If any city or airport codes have to be explicitly bound in this query, additional sub-queries may be necessary to first fetch those codes.

Question: show me fares from HOUSTON to LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares from Houston to Las Vegas, you can use a SQL query that joins the necessary tables. You'll need to retrieve the airport codes for Houston and Las Vegas, and then find the corresponding fares. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE.FARE_ID,
    FARE.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FARE.TO_AIRPORT,
    FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FARE.FARE_AIRLINE,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM FARE
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LAS VEGAS';
```

In this SQL query:
- We're selecting relevant fields from the FARE table.
- We're joining the FARE table with the AIRPORT table twice, once for the origin airport (HOUSTON) and once for the destination airport (LAS VEGAS).
- We filter the results based on the airport locations. Note that the actual condition might differ based on how the locations are defined in your database.

Make sure the actual column names used for the locations match those in your database schema. Adjust the filtering if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the fares from Dallas to San Francisco, you'll first need to identify the airport codes associated with each city, and then query the `FARE` table for the relevant data. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    F.FARE_AIRLINE, 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    FARE F 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

Make sure that:
1. The airport names ('DALLAS' and 'SAN FRANCISCO') match exactly with how they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table.
2. If the `AIRPORT_NAME` doesn't match, you may need to find the correct airport codes for Dallas and San Francisco and replace the airport names in the query with their corresponding codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Seattle to Minneapolis, you'll need to perform a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to filter for flights going from SEATTLE to MINNEAPOLIS. Based on your schema, you will primarily need the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT` tables to get the information you need. Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FARE F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SEATTLE' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MINNEAPOLIS';
```

- The query selects fare details including fare ID, fare basis code, fare airline, one-way cost, and round-trip cost.
- It joins the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Seattle) and once for the arrival airport (Minneapolis).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to find only the fares from Seattle to Minneapolis.

Make sure that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` column correctly identifies airports by city names. If the actual schema uses different identifiers to find Seattle and Minneapolis, you might need to adjust the query accordingly. If necessary, you can also use `AIRPORT_CODE` values for filtering.

Question: list all round trip fares from PHOENIX to WASHINGTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all round trip fares from PHOENIX to WASHINGTON, you would typically need to query the `FARE` table to get the relevant fares based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`. You would also want to check that the fares are specifically round trip fares as indicated by the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field.

Assuming that the `FARE` table has `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` that contain the respective airport codes for PHOENIX and WASHINGTON, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    F.FARE_AIRLINE, 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Phoenix')
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Washington')
    AND F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates that a round trip is required
```

### Notes:
1. Replace `AIRPORT_NAME` with appropriate identifiers if your structure is different or if you're using airport codes directly.
2. The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` condition assumes the value 'Y' signifies a round trip fare.
3. If there are multiple airports in Washington, you may need to modify the query to account for that complexity or to specify which Washington airport you are focusing on.
4. Ensure that the table and column names correspond to those defined in your database schema, as the case sensitivity and naming conventions can vary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip tickets from New York to Miami from the given database schema, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you have the relevant airport and fare information to make the connection.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,

WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI'
    AND FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight details, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and fare costs.
- It joins the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to gather necessary information.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from New York and arriving in Miami.
- Additionally, it includes a condition to ensure that only round-trip tickets are fetched by checking that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'Y'.

Question: i want a round trip fare from NEW YORK to SAN JOSE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the round trip fare from New York to San Jose using the provided database schema, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant airport codes for New York and San Jose.
2. Query the `FARE` table to find the round trip cost based on those airport codes.
3. Join necessary tables if needed to filter the results correctly.

Based on the assumption that you have the appropriate airport codes for New York and San Jose, the SQL query might look like the following:

```sql
-- Assuming the airport codes for New York (JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport) 
-- and San Jose (SJC for San Jose International Airport)

SELECT f.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM FARE f
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SJC'
  AND f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

In this query:
- Replace `'JFK'` with the actual airport code for New York if it's different (e.g., you may also consider LGA for LaGuardia or EWR for Newark).
- `'SJC'` is used for San Jose International Airport.
- The condition `f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that we only retrieve fares that are for round trips.

Make sure the airport codes match your database entries. If you're unsure of the airport codes, you might need a preliminary query to look them up using the `AIRPORT` table.

Question: could you please give me the round trip fare from DENVER to ATLANTA
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
Certainly! To obtain the round trip fare from Denver (DEN) to Atlanta (ATL) using your database schema, you'll need to join multiple tables: `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`. The SQL query below retrieves the round trip fare for flights between Denver and Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE.FARE_ID,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ON FARE.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT ON FLIGHT_FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND FARE.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'
    AND FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming this indicates a round trip is required
```

This query selects the `FARE_ID` and the `ROUND_TRIP_COST` of fares that match flights originating from Denver (`DEN`) and arriving in Atlanta (`ATL`), ensuring that the round trip is required. You can adjust the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` check based on how your data is structured (e.g., if it's a flag or a column value). 

Make sure to adapt the query if you have specific requirements or if the data schema has attributes that require filtering based on other parameters (like $ class, specific airlines, etc.).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from New York to Miami using the given database schema, you will need to join several tables. The query will likely involve the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FARE_FARE` and `FLIGHT` tables to ensure that the selected fare is indeed for a round trip flight.

Here's a SQL statement that accomplishes this:

```sql

```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Clause**: You select the relevant fields including fares and airport names.
2. **From Clause**: You start from the `FARE` table.
3. **Join Clauses**: You join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure (New York) and once for the arrival (Miami).
4. **Where Clause**: Filters results to only include fares from New York to Miami which are specifically marked as round trip (e.g., assuming a 'Y' indicates a round trip requirement). Adjust the condition based on the actual data representation for round trips in your database (it might vary, check your `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` values).

Make sure you check the exact names of the airports as they might have different representations in the `AIRPORT` table (e.g., JFK, LGA for New York).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from Denver (DEN) to Philadelphia (PHL), you need to join several tables, including the `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED,
    ap1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    ap2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE fa
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE f ON fa.FARE_ID = f.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap1 ON fa.FROM_AIRPORT = ap1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap2 ON fa.TO_AIRPORT = ap2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON ap1.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON ap2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    ap1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' AND
    ap2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHL' AND
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We select the relevant columns including fare ID, fare basis code, one direction cost, round trip cost, and the names of the originating and destination airports.
- The `FARE` table is joined to the `FARE_BASIS` table to access additional fare details.
- It then joins with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to connect flights with their respective fares.
- Additionally, the `AIRPORT` table is joined twice (once for each of the originating and destination airports) to get the airport names for Denver and Philadelphia.
- The `CITY` table is also joined to ensure that we're referencing the correct airport codes for their respective cities.
- The filter (`WHERE` clause) ensures we are only retrieving fares for a round trip from Denver to Philadelphia.

Make sure to adjust any column names or relationships according to your actual database schema if they differ!

Question: show me round trip fares from NEW YORK to MIAMI
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from New York to Miami, you will need to join the appropriate tables. Assuming that New York and Miami airports are specified in the `AIRPORT` table, you can write a SQL query that gathers the required data from the relevant tables, including the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT` tables.

Here’s an example SQL query that demonstrates how you might structure this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID = (SELECT ff.FARE_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE ff WHERE ff.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID)
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assumes 'Y' indicates that round trip is required
```

Make sure to replace `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT` table with their appropriate airport codes, as this query assumes airport names are directly usable. Additionally, confirm that `'Y'` is the right representation of round trips in your `FARE` table. 

If you have specific airport codes for New York (like JFK, LGA, EWR) and Miami (MIA), you could adjust the query to use those directly instead of the airport names for more accuracy. 

Here’s how that might look if you know the airport codes:

```sql
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR') 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
``` 

Make sure to run this query in an environment where the database schema is implemented correctly to get the desired results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares on all round-trip flights from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Oakland (OAK), you can use the following SQL query. This query will involve several joins across the relevant tables to link flights, fares, and airports.

Assuming that the `CITY` table has entries for Pittsburgh and Oakland with corresponding `CITY_CODE`s, and you are also considering the relevant round-trip fare conditions, here's what the SQL query might look like:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.RESTRICTION_CODE,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE

    c1.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip is required
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects flight details, fare details, including round-trip costs, one-direction costs, and fare restrictions.

2. **Joins**:
   - It joins the `FLIGHT` table to the `FARE_FARE` table to obtain the available fares for each flight.
   - It further joins to the `FARE` table to retrieve specific fare details.
   - Then it joins to the `AIRPORT` table to get those airports pertaining to the origin (Pittsburgh) and destination (Oakland).
   - Finally, it uses the `CITY` table to ensure we’re looking specifically at flights involving Pittsburgh and Oakland.

3. **Where Clause**: 
   - Filters the results to those flights originating from Pittsburgh and going to Oakland, ensuring to look only for round trips.

### Note:
- Be sure to modify `"Y"` in `fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` based on how the values are represented in your database, as the actual representation can vary (e.g. it could be 'Yes', 1, etc.). 
- Depending on your SQL environment, you might need to check the exact syntax for handling joins or any specific elements of your schema that differ from the assumed structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the round trip fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia, you need to join several tables in your database schema, focusing on the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FARE f 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fare_flt ON f.FARE_ID = fare_flt.FLIGHT_ID 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE 
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Baltimore' 
    AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Philadelphia'
    AND f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming this indicates a round trip fare
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Clause**: This specifies the columns that will be returned in the result set.
- **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: We join the `FARE` table with the `FLIGHT` table to link fares to flights, and we join the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the departure airport (Baltimore) and once for the destination airport (Philadelphia).
- **WHERE Clause**: We filter the airports to only include the Baltimore and Philadelphia airports and ensure that the fare is specifically for round trips (assuming 'Y' indicates this).

Note: Adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` in the `WHERE` clause if the names in your data are different or use the appropriate `AIRPORT_CODE` based on your schema if necessary.

Question: show me round trip fares from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Philadelphia (PHL), you will need to join the necessary tables based on the relevant fields. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.RESTRICTION_CODE,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FA.BOOKING_CLASS,
    FA.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FA ON F.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHL' AND 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:

- **FROM_AIRPORT** and **TO_AIRPORT** are filtered to 'PIT' (Pittsburgh) and 'PHL' (Philadelphia) respectively.
- The **ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED** is checked to ensure that only round trip fares are retrieved.
- The join between the `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables retrieves additional details about the booking class and class type associated with the fares.

Make sure that the airport codes `'PIT'` and `'PHL'` match those used in your database schema. Adjust them accordingly if they differ.

Question: please give me round trip fares from PITTSBURGH to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Philadelphia (PHL), you would first need to get the airport codes for each city, then join the relevant tables to get the fare information.  

Here's a sample SQL query that can accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE.FARE_ID, 
    FARE.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    FARE.TO_AIRPORT, 
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS,
    FARE_BASIS.CLASS_TYPE,
    FARE_BASIS.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PITTSBURGH' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip is required
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **SELECT statement**: You select specific fields, including fare details and any relevant fare basis class types.
- **JOINs**: You join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for both departures and arrivals.
- **WHERE clause**: You filter the results to include only those fares where the starting airport is Pittsburgh and the destination is Philadelphia. You also check if the fare requires a round trip.

Make sure to replace the conditions and fields based on the actual values/names used in your database schema, particularly the airport codes for Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the round trip fares from New York to San Jose, you would typically need to join several tables, including the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT` tables, among others. Here's an SQL query that could be used to find those fares assuming you have `NYC` as `FROM_AIRPORT` and `SJC` as `TO_AIRPORT` in your database.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.ROUNDS_TRIP_COST,
    F.RESTRICTION_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    R1.DESCRIPTION AS RESTRICTION_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
LEFT JOIN

WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'NEW YORK' 
AND 
    A2.CITY_CODE = 'SAN JOSE'
AND 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

Make sure to replace `'NEW YORK'` and `'SAN JOSE'` with the actual city codes or names used in your `CITY` table if necessary. 

Please keep in mind that the conditions and joining tables might need to be adjusted based on the specific details and relationships in your database.

Question: what would be cost of a round trip from PITTSBURGH to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of a round trip flight from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, we need to join several tables to get all the relevant information including the fare details. Here is the SQL query to get that information based on the database schema you've provided:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID  -- Assuming FLIGHT_ID is used as a reference
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco'
AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'YES'; -- Assuming you want only fares that allow round trips
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection**: We're selecting the flight ID, flight number, and round trip cost.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport).
   - We further join with the `FARE` table to get the fare details corresponding to the flights.
3. **Filtering**:
   - We filter based on the airport names for Pittsburgh and San Francisco.
   - We also filter to ensure we're only considering fares which are applicable for round trips.

### Note:
- Replace `'Pittsburgh'` and `'San Francisco'` with the exact names as they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table if they differ.
- Ensure that your actual database allows multiple joins and that the necessary foreign keys in related tables (like how flights relate to fares) are correctly mapped as indicated in the query. Adjust as necessary based on your specific database design and relationships.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip fares from Baltimore to Philadelphia, we need to join several tables, specifically focusing on the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables to identify the correct airport codes corresponding to these cities. Here is how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID, 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    F.ROUNND_TRIP_REQUIRED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHILADELPHIA'
    AND F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates that round trip is required
```

Make sure to adjust the actual column names in the conditionals according to your schema. This query selects the fare details for round-trip flights from Baltimore to Philadelphia, joining relevant information from the `FARE` and `AIRPORT` tables based on the airport locations.

Question: how much is a round trip fare from MEMPHIS to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the round trip fare from Memphis to Seattle, you will need to join several tables in the database schema you've provided. Specifically, you must identify the relevant airport codes for Memphis and Seattle, find the fare associated with those airports, and filter for round trip fares. Here's how you could write the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS TO_CITY ON TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: This clause specifies the column to retrieve, in this case, `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table.
2. **FROM FARE**: This indicates that we are starting our selection from the `FARE` table.
3. **JOIN**: We use joins to connect the `FARE` table with `AIRPORT` twice to get the departure and arrival airports. Additionally, we join with the `CITY` table to filter by city names.
4. **WHERE**: This clause filters the results to only include fares where the departure city is "MEMPHIS" and the arrival city is "SEATTLE".

Make sure the city names are correctly spelled as they are in your database, and the `CITY_CODE` in the `AIRPORT` table corresponds with the correct entry in the `CITY` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To list a round trip fare from Kansas City to Minneapolis, we'll assume that we have the necessary relationships between the tables based on the schema provided. We will need to join the relevant tables to find the flights and their associated fares for the specified route.

Here’s a sample SQL query to retrieve the round trip fares for flights from Kansas City (KCI) to Minneapolis (MSP):

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE,
    FLIGHT f2 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare2 ON ff2.FARE_ID = fare2.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT b1 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = b1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT b2 ON f2.TO_AIRPORT = b2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Kansas City' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Minneapolis' 
    AND b1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Minneapolis' 
    AND b2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Kansas City' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight numbers, departure and arrival times for both the outbound flight from Kansas City to Minneapolis and the return flight from Minneapolis to Kansas City, as well as the round trip cost.
  
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get fare details associated with each flight.
   - The `FARE` table is joined to retrieve costs, specifically the round trip cost.
   - The `AIRPORT` table is joined multiple times to filter based on the departure and arrival airports.

3. **Filter Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause filters the records for flights departing from Kansas City to Minneapolis and returning to Kansas City.

Please make sure to replace 'Kansas City' and 'Minneapolis' with the actual airport names if they differ in your dataset or use the relevant airport codes directly.

SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the round-trip fare from Nashville to Seattle, you need to join several tables. Specifically, you can focus on the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to establish the connection between the cities and their respective airports. Here's an example SQL query that retrieves the round-trip fare for a flight from Nashville to Seattle:

```sql
SELECT F.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM FARE F
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'NASHVILLE' AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Select**: We're selecting the `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table.
2. **Joins**:
   - We join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for both origin and destination.
   - We further join the `CITY` table to filter for Nashville and Seattle.
3. **Where Clause**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to show only fares that originate from Nashville and end in Seattle.

### Note:
- Make sure the city names and codes are correctly represented in your database, as SQL is case-sensitive.
- Depending on the structure of your data, you might want to include additional filters, but this query captures the essential logic to find the round-trip fare.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all round trip fares from St. Petersburg to Washington, you will need to join the necessary tables based on the schema provided. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_From ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_From.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_To ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_To.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_From.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. PETERSBURG' AND
    A_To.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' AND
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT**: We are selecting specific columns that provide information about the fares.
- **FROM FARE**: This indicates that we are starting our query from the `FARE` table.
- **JOIN AIRPORT**: We join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the details of the departure airport (St. Petersburg) and once to get the details of the destination airport (Washington).
- **WHERE**: We apply conditions to filter the records:
  - The departure airport name must be 'ST. PETERSBURG'.
  - The arrival airport name must be 'WASHINGTON'.
  - We are specifically looking for fares that are required to be round trips (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport names 'ST. PETERSBURG' and 'WASHINGTON' are accurate as they are case-sensitive based on how they were recorded in the database.
- You can adjust the field selection based on what specific fare details you need.

Question: could you please give me the cost of a round trip flight from DENVER to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a round-trip flight from Denver (DEN) to Pittsburgh (PIT), you would typically need to join multiple tables, particularly the FARE and FLIGHT tables. Here's an SQL query that retrieves the round-trip cost for flights between these two airports, assuming the FARE table contains the relevant pricing information.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE fare
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fare_flight ON fare.FARE_ID = fare_flight.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'PIT'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip is required
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the airline code, flight number, and round-trip cost.
- **FROM and JOIN Statements**: Queries the `FARE` table and joins it with the `FLIGHT` table to get corresponding flights.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights from Denver (DEN) to Pittsburgh (PIT) and ensures that the fare is valid for round trips.

### Notes:
1. Ensure that the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` values match those stored in your database.
2. If other attributes or conditions (like specific dates) are needed, you should enhance the `WHERE` clause accordingly.
3. Depending on how the fare is structured, you may need to consider additional conditions or join other tables as well, such as flight schedules or specific airline details.

Question: how much is a round trip fare from INDIANAPOLIS to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the round trip fare from Indianapolis to Seattle, we need to gather information from the relevant tables. The process involves:

1. Identifying the airports associated with Indianapolis and Seattle.
2. Retrieving the fare from Indianapolis to Seattle from the `FARE` table.
3. Retrieving the fare from Seattle to Indianapolis, if required.
4. If necessary, summing up both fares to get the round trip cost.

Assuming 'INDIANAPOLIS' corresponds to a city in the `CITY` table and has an airport in the `AIRPORT` table, here is an example SQL query to obtain the round trip fare:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM 
    FARE f1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';
```

This query does the following:

- Joins the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for Indianapolis and Seattle.
- Joins with the `CITY` table to filter based on the city names.
- Selects the round trip cost where the departure is from Indianapolis and destination is Seattle.

Please ensure that the city names and airport codes match the entries in your existing database, as naming conventions could vary.

    f1.ROUND_TRIP_COST

Question: show me round trip fares from SAN JOSE to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip fares from San Jose (SJC) to Salt Lake City (SLC), we’ll need to join several tables based on their relationships, particularly focusing on the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables.

Here’s the SQL query to show round-trip fares from San Jose to Salt Lake City:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS From_Airport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS To_Airport,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE AS Fare_Basis_Code,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE AS Airline_Code
FROM 
    FARE fare
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON fare.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SJC' -- San Jose Airport Code
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SLC' -- Salt Lake City Airport Code
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Only select round trip fares
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM Clause**: We start from the `FARE` table to get fare details.
- **JOINs**:
  - Join `FLIGHT_FARE` to get the specific flights associated with each fare.
  - Join `FLIGHT` to get the specific flight numbers and details.
  - Join `AIRPORT` twice: once for the origin airport (San Jose) and once for the destination airport (Salt Lake City).
- **WHERE Clause**: We filter results where the from airport is San Jose (using its airport code 'SJC'), the to airport is Salt Lake City ('SLC'), and we ensure that the fare is a round trip.

Make sure that you have the correct airport codes ('SJC' for San Jose and 'SLC' for Salt Lake City) in your database schema before executing the query. Adjust the codes if they differ in your actual schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trip fares between San Francisco and Washington, you will need to join the relevant tables in the database schema. Specifically, you'll need to look at the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly the `CITY` tables to get the correct airport codes for San Francisco and Washington.

Here is the SQL query that retrieves the round trip fares between San Francisco and Washington:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE fa 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON fa.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON fa.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SAN FRANCISCO%' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%'
    AND fa.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip is required
```

### Explanation:
- We select the `FARE_ID`, airport names for the departure and arrival, and the round trip cost.
- We join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (San Francisco) and once for the arrival airport (Washington).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for airport names containing "SAN FRANCISCO" and "WASHINGTON", along with ensuring that the fare is for a round trip by checking `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`. You should adjust the `LIKE` conditions based on the actual airport names in your database. 

Make sure to replace the string conditions in the `WHERE` clause with the actual names or codes used in your specific database if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all round-trip fares from PITTSBURGH to WASHINGTON, we will need to join the relevant tables in the database schema. The key tables involved in this query are `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT` to filter the route appropriately.

```

### Explanation of the Query:

- We select the fare ID, from airport code, to airport code, round trip cost, whether a round trip is required, and the airline offering the fare.
- We join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (PITTSBURGH) and once for the destination airport (WASHINGTON).
- The `WHERE` clause filters out only those records where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is PITTSBURGH and the `TO_AIRPORT` is WASHINGTON.
- Additionally, we ensure that the fare is for a round trip by filtering on `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`.

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` condition if the actual airport names in your database may differ (i.e., if they are using airport codes or specific terminologies).

Question: what are the fares for flights between BOSTON and WASHINGTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE = "DC" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares for flights between Boston and Washington, you need to join several tables: `FLIGHT` to get the flights, `FARE` to get the fare details, and `AIRPORT` to identify the airport codes for Boston and Washington.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight number, departure and arrival times, and fare costs.
2. **Joins**: 
   - `FLIGHT` is joined with `AIRPORT` for both departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and arrival (`TO_AIRPORT`) to find the right airport codes.
   - `FLIGHT` is also joined with `FLIGHT_FARE` to link each flight to its respective fare information.
   - Finally, `FLIGHT_FARE` is joined with `FARE` to get the actual fare details.
3. **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters results to include only flights from Boston to Washington.

Ensure that the names "BOSTON" and "WASHINGTON" are consistent with how they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table (e.g., full airport names or codes).

SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,

Question: show me the one way flights from ATLANTA to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the one-way flights from Atlanta (ATL) to Pittsburgh (PIT), you would need to query the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially other related tables to combine the necessary information. The query should include the flight details, such as flight number, departure time, and arrival time, filtering specifically for the given airports.

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ATL' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve, including flight number, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
   
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates the main table `FLIGHT` that contains the details of flights.

3. **JOIN Clause**: 
   - The first `JOIN` connects the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the departure airport (Atlanta).
   - The second `JOIN` connects again to the `AIRPORT` table to fetch details for the arrival airport (Pittsburgh).

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Atlanta (ATL) and arriving in Pittsburgh (PIT). 

Make sure that the airport codes used (like 'ATL' and 'PIT') match the codes stored in your database.

Question: i'd like to see all the one way flights from DENVER to PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all one-way flights from Denver to Pittsburgh, we first need to identify the airport codes of both cities, then find the relevant flights in the database that match the criteria. Assuming that `DENVER` corresponds to the airport code `DEN` and `PITTSBURGH` corresponds to `PIT`, we can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- Assuming 'N' indicates one-way
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting relevant columns**: We select the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, the number of stops, time elapsed for the flight, and the one-way fare.
  
2. **Joining tables**: 
   - `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   - `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FARE` table to get the fare information.

3. **Filtering Criteria**:
   - We filter the results based on the airport codes for Denver (`DEN`) and Pittsburgh (`PIT`).
   - We ensure that the flight is a one-way flight by checking that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'N' (assuming that 'N' indicates a one-way flight; this should be confirmed based on the actual definitions in your database).

Make sure to replace `'DEN'` and `'PIT'` with the actual airport codes if they are different in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To create a one-way flight from Boston to Atlanta, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant airport codes for Boston and Atlanta.**
2. **Select the available flights from Boston to Atlanta.**
3. **Look up available fares for the selected flights.**

Below is an SQL query that demonstrates how to find one-way flights from Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    M.MEAL_CODE,
    FD.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS FARE_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE_ID FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FD ON FF.FARE_ID = FD.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND 
    FD.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'   -- ensuring it's a one-way fare
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
- **Selecting**: The query selects flight details like flight number, departure and arrival times, number of stops, flight duration, and fare costs.
- **Joins**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRLINE` to fetch the airline name and with `FARE_FARE_ID` and `FARE` to get fare details.
- **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters flights departing from Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL) and checks that the fare is for a one-way trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'`).
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by departure time.

### Note:
Make sure to replace the airport codes (`BOS` for Boston and `ATL` for Atlanta) with the correct codes from your `AIRPORT` table if they differ. Additionally, ensure that your database has the latest flight and fare data for accurate results.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table, filtering flights that depart from Milwaukee and arrive in Orlando. You can do this by joining relevant tables to get the necessary information such as airport codes and any other required details.

Assuming that "MILWAUKEE" refers to the city Milwaukee and "ORLANDO" refers to the city Orlando, we first need to get the corresponding airport codes for each city. This usually involves a join with the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables.

Here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND
    C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER IS NOT NULL;  -- Assuming we're checking for valid flights
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Statement**: We're selecting relevant flight details (such as flight ID, airline code, flight number, departure/arrival times, etc.).
2. **From Clause**: We're looking at the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source of flight information.
3. **Join with Airport and City**: We are joining the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to filter flights that originate from Milwaukee and terminate in Orlando.
4. **Where Clause**: Filters the results for flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Orlando.

Make sure the city names match the data in your database (e.g., case sensitivity) and that you have the relevant airport codes in your `AIRPORT` table for these cities.

Question: now i need a one way flight from PITTSBURGH to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a one-way flight from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Denver (DEN), you would typically need to gather information from multiple tables in the database schema provided. The main tables involved would be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FARE`. The SQL query below demonstrates how to retrieve a list of available flights for a one-way trip from Pittsburgh to Denver.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT' AND   -- Pittsburgh Airport Code
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN'       -- Denver Airport Code
    AND FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- Ensure it's a one way flight
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the desired columns such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airport names, departure and arrival times, elapsed time, and fare details.
  
2. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Joins the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` to get the names of the airports for both departure and arrival.
   - Joins with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to access fare details for the flights.

3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters to find flights departing from Pittsburgh (airport code 'PIT') and arriving in Denver (airport code 'DEN').
   - Ensures that results only include one-way flights by checking that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` is 'N' (assuming 'N' indicates no round trip is required).

You can modify the columns in the `SELECT` clause based on the specific information you need about the flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a one-way flight from Boston to San Francisco using the provided database schema, you can write a SQL query that joins the necessary tables to filter flights based on the departure and arrival airports. 

Here’s an example of how you can write that SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT Clause**: This clause selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, departure/arrival times, time elapsed, and one-way cost of the flight.
- **FROM Clause**: It specifies the main table, which is `FLIGHT`.
- **JOIN Clauses**: 
  - We join `AIRPORT` twice: once for the departure airport (Boston) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
  - We join `FARE` to potentially include fare information for the flight.
- **WHERE Clause**: It filters for flights specifically from Boston to San Francisco.

Make sure that the airport names match exactly as they are listed in your `AIRPORT` table, as this SQL query is case-sensitive. You may need to update the `WHERE` clause based on the exact names stored in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To show all one-way flights from Ontario to Tacoma, you'll need to join the relevant tables based on the airport codes corresponding to those cities. Below is an example SQL query that retrieves the necessary information related to these flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'ONTARIO' AND STATE_CODE = 'CA') 
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'TACOMA' AND STATE_CODE = 'WA')
    AND F.FLIGHT_ID 
    IN (SELECT FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We specify the fields we want to see, like flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, total travel time, number of stops, connections, and meal code. We also obtain the names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `F`). 

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - We join `FLIGHT` with the `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `A1` for departure and `A2` for arrival) to get airport names corresponding to the flight's `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`.

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - We filter the records for flights departing from Ontario (where CITY_NAME is "ONTARIO" and STATE_CODE is "CA") and arriving in Tacoma (where CITY_NAME is "TACOMA" and STATE_CODE is "WA").

5. **Subqueries**: We use subqueries to find the `CITY_CODE` for Ontario and Tacoma from the `CITY` table.

Please make sure to replace 'CA' and 'WA' with the correct state codes for Ontario and Tacoma as applicable. Adjust table names and fields if needed based on your actual schema.

Question: show me the one way flights from DETROIT to WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Detroit (which corresponds to an airport code, likely "DTW") to Westchester County (which corresponds to its airport code, likely "HPN"), you can use the following SQL query. The assumption here is that the airport codes and the respective flight details are stored in the `FLIGHT` table. Below is a sample SQL query to fetch the required flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DTW'  -- Assuming DTW is the airport code for Detroit
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'HPN'  -- Assuming HPN is the airport code for Westchester County
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS IS NULL;  -- Assuming that there's no restriction on flight days for one-way flights
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve, including flight details and airport names.
- **JOINs**: Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get readable airport names for both the departure and arrival.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters to find flights specifically from Detroit (identified by its airport code "DTW") to Westchester County (identified by its airport code "HPN").
- **FLIGHT_DAYS IS NULL**: (Optional) Assumes there are no specific restrictions on flight days; you can adjust this based on your actual data structure or requirements.

You may need to refine the query based on your actual `AIRPORT_CODE`s for Detroit and Westchester County if they differ from the assumptions made here.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about flights between Milwaukee and Orlando in a one-way format, you would typically need to join several tables to gather all relevant data. Here’s an SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS,
    f.MEAL_CODE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fd.CITY_NAME AS FROM_CITY,
    td.CITY_NAME AS TO_CITY
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY fd ON from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = fd.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY td ON to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = td.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    fd.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND 
    td.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns, such as flight number, airline name, departure time, arrival time, flight duration, number of stops, meal code, and one-way cost.
- It joins the FLIGHT table with the AIRLINE table to get the airline name, and with the AIRPORT and CITY tables to filter based on the departure and arrival cities (Milwaukee and Orlando).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only flights from Milwaukee to Orlando and specifies that only one-way fares (no return trip required) should be included.

Make sure that the specific column names, especially in the JOIN conditions (like airport and city codes), match the structure of your actual database schema, as there might be variations in how the data is structured or named.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flight information from Milwaukee to Orlando based on your provided database schema, you would primarily utilize the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables. Here's a sample SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    ff.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.MEAL_CODE,

JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando'
    AND ff.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- Assuming 'N' indicates one-way
```

### Explanation of the SQL Components:
- **SELECT Clause**: Selects the pertinent columns including flight number, airline code, airport names for departure and arrival, departure and arrival times, costs, meal code, number of stops, and total time elapsed.
- **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: 
   - `FLIGHT` is the main table containing flight details.
   - Joined `AIRPORT` twice to retrieve names for both the departure and arrival airports.
   - Joined `FLIGHT_FARE` to retrieve fare information.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to flights going from Milwaukee to Orlando and checking if the flight is one-way (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` set to 'N').

Make sure to replace the airport names with the appropriate codes or names in your dataset if they differ from those provided in the question.

Question: all one way flights between BOSTON and PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all one-way flights between Boston and Philadelphia, you'll need to use a SQL query that involves joining several tables within the provided database schema. You will primarily need the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly the `FLIGHT_FARE` table if you want fare information. 

Here’s a structured SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST -- Optional if you want to include fare information
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
-- Optional: Join with FLIGHT_FARE if fare details are needed
-- JOIN 
--     FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Philadelphia' AND
    f.CONNECTIONS = 0; -- Assuming CONNECTIONS = 0 indicates a non-stop flight
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Columns**: The query selects relevant columns for flight details, including flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, elapsed time, issuance of airport names (from both origin and destination), and the airline name.
- **Joining Tables**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table to match the departure and arrival airports and with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline information for the flights.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from Boston and arriving in Philadelphia. The `CONNECTIONS = 0` condition is used to ensure only non-stop (one-way) flights are selected.
  
You would need to adjust the exact column names based on the actual contents of the `AIRPORT` and `AIRLINE` tables since there might be variations in naming conventions.

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table along with other relevant tables that provide details about the departure and arrival airports, as well as the flights. Below is an example SQL query that retrieves this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUNTRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'General Mitchell International Airport'  -- Assuming Milwaukee's airport name
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando International Airport'       -- Assuming Orlando's airport name
    AND f.STOPS = 0;                                           -- One-way flight has no stops
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT** clause is used to choose which fields you want to show, including flight number, departure and arrival times, stops, elapsed time, and costs.
- **FROM** clause specifies the main table `FLIGHT` (aliased as `f`).
- **JOIN** clauses are used to link the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT`, `AIRLINE`, and `FARE` tables to get the necessary details about the flights and associated costs.
- **WHERE** clause filters the results to find flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Orlando. It also ensures that only one-way flights (with zero stops) are included. 

Make sure to replace `"General Mitchell International Airport"` and `"Orlando International Airport"` with the actual airport codes or names as they exist in the database if they differ.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find travel arrangements for a one-way flight from San Francisco to Dallas, you'll need to write an SQL query that joins several tables to retrieve relevant information. Assuming you know the airport codes for San Francisco and Dallas, the resulting SQL might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    FL.FIGHT_LEG,
    Fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.STOPS,
    Meal.MEAL_DESCRIPTION,
    R.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE Fare ON F.FLIGHT_ID = Fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE Meal ON F.MEAL_CODE = Meal.MEAL_CODE
LEFT JOIN 
    RESTRICTION R ON Fare.RESTRICTION_CODE = R.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas' AND
    F.STOPS = 0; --You can adjust or remove conditions based on specific requirements
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects various columns such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, airport names, meal descriptions, and more.
   
2. **Joins**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the departure airport (San Francisco) and once for the arrival airport (Dallas).
   - The `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FOOD_SERVICE` tables are joined to get fare information and meal details.
   - The `RESTRICTION` table is left joined to fetch any restrictions related to the fare.

3. **Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause filters results based on the specified airports. You can customize it by adding or changing conditions, such as including flights with stops or specific airlines.

### Note:
Make sure to replace `'San Francisco'` and `'Dallas'` with their respective airport codes (`SFO` for San Francisco and `DFW` for Dallas) if you have them.

Question: give me the one way flights from PITTSBURGH to BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Boston (BOS), you can construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` to get the necessary flight information. Below is a sample SQL query that would achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PITTSBURGH' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BOSTON'
    AND FLIGHT.STOPS = 0;  -- This indicates that we want direct flights
```

### Explanation of the Query
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve, such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, number of stops, time elapsed, and fare costs.
- **FROM**: Specifies the main table to query (`FLIGHT`).
- **JOIN**: Combines rows from different tables based on related columns (in this case, joining `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` and `AIRLINE` to get airport and airline information, and `FLIGHT_FARE` for fare information).
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to include only flights from Pittsburgh to Boston and options for one-way flights by ensuring that `STOPS` is equal to 0 (indicating a direct flight).

### Note
You may need to adjust the filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause based on the actual data structure and values in your database, such as checking against the `CITY` or the proper airport codes instead of string comparisons.

Question: hi could i get a one way ticket from MILWAUKEE to ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about a one-way ticket from Milwaukee (MKE) to Orlando (MCO), you would typically need to join tables that hold flight and fare information while also filtering the records based on the origination and destination airports. The tables of interest include `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially others that might include specific fare information.

Here's an example SQL query that could help you find one-way flight tickets from Milwaukee to Orlando. Note that you might need to adjust column names based on your exact needs or any additional constraints such as dates or classes of service:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT, 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MKE' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MCO'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- This assumes a flag to indicate one-way tickets
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting relevant flight details such as flight number, arrival and departure times, airline code, and the names of the departure and destination airports.
- The `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables are joined to get necessary details about each flight and its available fares.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights that specifically depart from Milwaukee (with airport code 'MKE') and arrive at Orlando (with airport code 'MCO'). 
- We also filter based on whether the fare is for a one-way ticket by checking the `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field is set to 'N'.

Make sure that your actual column names and airport codes align with those in the database schema you provided. Adjust the sorting or additional filters (like dates) as needed for your specific use case.

Question: i want a one way ticket from DALLAS to BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a one-way ticket from Dallas (airport code: DFW) to Baltimore (airport code: BWI), you will need to query the relevant tables to get flight information, fares, and any additional details needed for the ticket. Here’s an example SQL query that demonstrates how to do this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'DALLAS%'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'BALTIMORE%'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- Assumes 'N' means it's one-way
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, departure time, arrival time, ticket cost for one direction, fare basis code, and restriction code.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table to get the details of flights.

3. **JOINs**: 
   - Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure (from) and arrival (to) airports.
   - Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to connect the flight information with its corresponding fares.
   - Joins the `FARE` table to get the financial details regarding the ticket costs.

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights from Dallas to Baltimore while ensuring it’s a one-way ticket (not requiring a round trip).

Make sure you replace `'DALLAS%'` and `'BALTIMORE%'` with the specific airport codes `DFW` and `BWI` if necessary. If airport codes are being used directly, the condition can also be as follows:

```sql
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DFW'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BWI'
``` 

This query will give you a list of available one-way tickets from Dallas to Baltimore with associated costs.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando, you'd want to join the relevant tables to get the necessary details about the flights, including flight numbers, departure and arrival airports, times, and any associated fare information. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    ff.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'MILWAUKEE' AND
    a2.CITY_CODE = 'ORLANDO' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N';  -- Assuming this indicates a one-way flight
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT** clause: Specifies the columns to be returned in the result, including flight numbers, airline codes, airport names, departure and arrival times, fare details, etc.
- **FROM** and **JOIN** clauses: Enables joining multiple tables—`FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`—to get the necessary details.
- **WHERE** clause: Filters the results to include only flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Orlando. It assumes the city codes for Milwaukee and Orlando are defined in the `CITY` table (you might need to adjust the city codes accordingly).
- Assumes that `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'` is used in the `FARE` table to filter for one-way flights, ensuring only one-way fares are selected.

Make sure to check the actual city codes for Milwaukee and Orlando in the `CITY` table, as they may differ in your database schema.

Question: give me flights from BALTIMORE to DENVER on UA that offer FIRST class
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Baltimore to Denver on United Airlines (UA) that offer FIRST class, you would need to join several tables from the provided schema, including `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and any other relevant tables to filter on the specified criteria.

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER' AND
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' AND
    fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Fields**: The query selects relevant fields including flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, the names of the departure and destination airports, and costs associated with the fare.
   
2. **Joins**: The query joins `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` to get airport names for both departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and arrival (`TO_AIRPORT`). It also joins `FLIGHT_FARE` to link flights to fare information and then joins `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` to filter the booking class.

3. **Where Clause**: The filter includes:
   - Departure from Baltimore and arrival in Denver.
   - Flights operated by United Airlines (indicated by the airline code 'UA').
   - Flights offering FIRST class service (specified by `BOOKING_CLASS` being 'FIRST').

Make sure that the airport names in the condition match exactly what is stored in your database (e.g. ensure there are no typos, or consider using the airport codes if they are known).

Raw LLM Response:
To list all FIRST class flights on United Airlines (UA) from Denver to Baltimore, you need to join several tables to retrieve the relevant information, including flight details, fare classes, and destination information.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FFLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    FFLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,

```

### Explanation:
- **FROM FLIGHT**: Selects from the `FLIGHT` table to get flight details.
- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE**: Joins with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to associate flights with fare details.
- **JOIN FARE**: Joins with the `FARE` table to get specific fare information.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve UA (United Airlines) flights from Denver to Baltimore that are classified as First Class flights, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you have the necessary relationships set up between the tables as per the schema provided.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI'  -- Assuming BALTIMORE airport code is BWI
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F'; -- Assuming 'F' is the Booking Class for First Class
```

Make sure you verify the airport codes for Denver and Baltimore. 'DEN' and 'BWI' are commonly used, but they should match your actual database entries. Also, ensure that the booking class representation for First Class is correct as per your `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table or any defined codes in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the necessary information about coach class flights on TW (Trans World Airlines) from Columbus to St. Paul, we will need to join several tables based on the relationships defined in the provided schema. The relevant tables include `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `AIRPORT`, and optionally others for more detailed information about the airlines or airports.

Here is an SQL query that captures this requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'TW' 
    AND a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'COLUMBUS')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'ST. PAUL')
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'COACH';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting fields such as flight number, departure/arrival times, airport names, and fare costs.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` twice to get the names of the originating and destination airports.
- We join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to obtain the costs associated with each flight.
- `FARE_BASIS` is then joined to ensure that we filter the results to only include coach class flights.
- The filtering criteria involve the airline code as 'TW', the city names for Columbus and St. Paul, and the booking class as 'COACH'. 

Make sure to adjust the city names in the subqueries if there's any discrepancy in their actual names recorded in your `CITY` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about an American Airlines (AA) flight in First Class from Philadelphia to Dallas, you would need to join several tables in your database schema. Below is an example of how you might construct such a SQL query assuming you are looking for flights that meet these criteria:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FROM_A.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    TO_A.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_A ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FF.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE

WHERE 
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND FROM_A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND TO_A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS'
    AND C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'FIRST'
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT F**: Main table for flight details.
- **AIRLINE A**: Join to get the airline's name from the airline code in the flight.
- **AIRPORT FROM_A**: Join to get the details of the departure airport (Philadelphia).
- **AIRPORT TO_A**: Join to get the details of the arrival airport (Dallas).
- **FLIGHT_FARE FF**: Join to connect flights with their fare information.
- **FARE**: Join to obtain cost details for the selected fare.
- **FARE_BASIS FB**: Join to find more details associated with the fare basis.
- **CLASS_OF_SERVICE C**: Join to obtain the class description (FIRST, in this case).
- **WHERE clause**: Filters to ensure we only get AA flights, originating from Philadelphia to Dallas in First Class.

You may need to adjust the field names or conditions based on the specific naming conventions or data you have in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that are in FIRST class on American Airlines (AA) between Dallas and Philadelphia, you would typically need to join multiple tables to gather the necessary information about the flights, class of service, and airport details. Below is a SQL query that demonstrates how to do this based on the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FAR ON FF.FARE_ID = FAR.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FAR.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE COS ON FB.BOOKING_CLASS = COS.BOOKING_CLASS
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    COS.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'FIRST'
    AND A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
    AND FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DALLAS%'
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%PHILADELPHIA%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- **SELECT Clause**: This retrieves the flight number, departure and arrival times, airline name, class description, and names of the departure and arrival airports.
- **FROM Clause**: It starts from the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as F).
- **JOINs**: These are used to connect the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `CLASS_OF_SERVICE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to access all relevant information.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters for flights that are in 'FIRST' class, belong to 'AA' (American Airlines), and depart from a Dallas airport to a Philadelphia airport. The use of `LIKE` is to ensure we match the airport names, which may have variations.

This query will return the relevant flight information for FIRST class flights on American Airlines between Dallas and Philadelphia.

Raw LLM Response:
To check if United Airlines (UA) provides any First Class flights from Denver to Baltimore, you need to gather information from several tables. The relevant tables are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `CITY` to link the airports in Denver and Baltimore.

Here’s an example SQL query that might help you find this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' AND 
    c2.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' AND 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' AND 
    fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F';  -- Assuming 'F' represents first-class
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT Table (f)**: Contains all the flight details.
2. **FARE Table (fa)**: Contains fare-related information attached to the flights.
3. **FARE_BASIS Table (fb)**: Holds the fare classes available for the tickets, ensuring we are looking for 'F' (first class).
4. **AIRPORT Table (a1 and a2)**: Combines information from the AIRPORT table to get codes for Denver and Baltimore.
5. **CITY Table (c1 and c2)**: Checks city names for the correct airports (in this case, DENVER and BALTIMORE).

### Notes:
- Make sure to substitute the actual booking class for First Class if it is represented differently in your schema.
- Adjust city and airport names according to the actual data in the database if they differ.
- If necessary, you may need additional joins or conditions based on your specific schema details.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Newark, New Jersey to Cleveland, Ohio, you would typically want to join several tables to gather all relevant information including flight details, departure, and arrival airports. Below is a sample SQL query that demonstrates how to do this, assuming that the tables are properly populated with relevant data:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK' 
    AND c1.STATE_CODE = 'NJ'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND c2.STATE_CODE = 'OH';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Specifies the columns you wish to retrieve, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, names of departure and arrival airports, and additional flight details (like stops and elapsed time).
  
- **FROM Clause**: Indicates the main table containing flight data.

- **JOINs**: 
  - The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice to get details for the departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and arrival (`TO_AIRPORT`) airports.
  - The `CITY` table is joined to ensure that we filter the airports based on the city and state criteria provided.
  
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters to include only flights from Newark, NJ to Cleveland, OH by matching the city and state codes for both departure and destination.

Make sure the city names and state codes match exactly those in the respective tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a listing of flights from Kansas City, Missouri (KCI) to Salt Lake City, Utah (SLC), you can use the following SQL query. This query uses the relevant tables in the database schema provided to gather the necessary information about flights between these two cities, including details such as flight number, departure time, arrival time, and associated airlines.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    AP_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'KANSAS CITY' AND 
    AP_FROM.STATE_CODE = 'MO' AND
    AP_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SALT LAKE CITY' AND 
    AP_TO.STATE_CODE = 'UT';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

- **FLIGHT F**: The main table selected that contains flight details.
- **JOIN AIRLINE A**: Joining the AIRLINE table to get the airline name associated with the flight.
- **JOIN AIRPORT AP_FROM**: Joining to the AIRPORT table to get details about the departure airport, which helps filter to Kansas City.
- **JOIN AIRPORT AP_TO**: Joining to the AIRPORT table to get details about the arrival airport, which helps filter to Salt Lake City.
- **WHERE clause**: Filters the results to flights that depart from Kansas City (MO) and arrive in Salt Lake City (UT). 

Make sure the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` field corresponds to the format and data used in your database if you need to adjust the filtering criteria. If `AIRPORT_CODE` alone is available, make sure to use that instead for filtering.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Newark, New Jersey to Cleveland, Ohio, you need to find the corresponding airport codes for both cities and then query the flights that connect these two airports. Here's the SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK' 
    AND c1.STATE_CODE = 'NJ'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND c2.STATE_CODE = 'OH';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and once for the arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`).
   - The `AIRPORT` table is then joined with the `CITY` table to match the airport locations with city names.

2. **Filtering with WHERE clause**:
   - The query filters the results for flights originating from Newark, NJ and arriving at Cleveland, OH.

3. **Selected Columns**: 
   - It selects relevant columns such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, departure and arrival airport names, departure and arrival times, number of connections, and number of stops.
  
Make sure to adjust any column names or logic based on the actual database structure if needed, and double-check that city codes align with the airport codes!

Question: please list the flights from ONTARIO CALIFORNIA to ORLANDO FLORIDA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , STATE AS STATEalias0 , STATE AS STATEalias1 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ONTARIO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND STATEalias0.STATE_CODE = CITYalias0.STATE_CODE AND STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "CALIFORNIA" AND STATEalias1.STATE_CODE = CITYalias1.STATE_CODE AND STATEalias1.STATE_NAME = "FLORIDA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Ontario, California to Orlando, Florida using the provided database schema, we first need to identify the airport codes for both locations. Assuming 'ONTARIO CALIFORNIA' corresponds to a certain airport code (let's say it's "ONT") and 'ORLANDO FLORIDA' corresponds to another airport code (let's assume it's "ORL"), we can write an SQL query to fetch the required flight information.

Here’s the SQL query you would use to retrieve the flights from Ontario, California to Orlando, Florida:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID,
       f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
       f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
       f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
       a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
       a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
       f.AIRLINE_CODE,
       al.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ONTARIO CALIFORNIA' 
  AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO FLORIDA';
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT**: We specify the columns we want to return, which includes flight details, from and to airport names, and the airline name.
- **FROM**: We start querying from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both the origin and destination airports. We also join the `AIRLINE` table to get the name of the airline.
- **WHERE**: We filter the results to include only flights originating from "ONTARIO CALIFORNIA" and destined for "ORLANDO FLORIDA".

Make sure to replace "ONTARIO CALIFORNIA" and "ORLANDO FLORIDA" with their actual airport codes in the query if they differ from those used in this example. If the actual codes (i.e., `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`) are known, you can directly use them in the WHERE clause to make the query more efficient.

Question: give me the flights from MEMPHIS TENNESSEE to CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , STATE AS STATEalias0 , STATE AS STATEalias1 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND STATEalias0.STATE_CODE = CITYalias0.STATE_CODE AND STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "TENNESSEE" AND STATEalias1.STATE_CODE = CITYalias1.STATE_CODE AND STATEalias1.STATE_NAME = "NORTH CAROLINA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Memphis, Tennessee to Charlotte, North Carolina, you would need to join several tables to obtain the relevant information. You will need to get the airport codes for Memphis and Charlotte from the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables, then use those airport codes to filter the flights from the `FLIGHT` table. Here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND 
    C1.STATE_CODE = 'TN' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE' AND 
    C2.STATE_CODE = 'NC';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Memphis) and once for the arrival airport (Charlotte).
- Each `AIRPORT` is then joined with the `CITY` table to ensure you're matching the appropriate cities and states.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the cities to ensure the correct origin (`MEMPHIS, TN`) and destination (`CHARLOTTE, NC`).
- The `SELECT` statement specifies the fields you want to retrieve about the flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Long Beach, California to Memphis, Tennessee, you would need to follow the relationships between the tables in your database schema. You would generally need to join the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to identify the routes.

Here is a sample SQL query to find all flights from Long Beach, California to Memphis, Tennessee:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    STATE S1 ON C1.STATE_CODE = S1.STATE_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    STATE S2 ON C2.STATE_CODE = S2.STATE_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'LONG BEACH' AND 
    S1.STATE_NAME = 'CALIFORNIA' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND 
    S2.STATE_NAME = 'TENNESSEE';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table contains the necessary flight details.
- The `AIRPORT` table is joined to get the airport names for both the departure and arrival airports.
- The `CITY` and `STATE` tables are joined to filter for the specific cities (Long Beach and Memphis) and their respective states (California and Tennessee).
- The `WHERE` clause specifically filters the records for the desired cities and states.

Make sure to replace `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, etc. with the exact columns you're interested in displaying based on your requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve morning flights departing from San Francisco (SFO) and arriving in Boston (BOS) in the afternoon, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that morning flight hours are typically considered to be between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM, and that afternoon hours are considered to be between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SFO' -- San Francisco Airport
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS' -- Boston Airport
    AND TIME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59' -- Morning flights
    AND TIME(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59' -- Afternoon arrivals
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Columns:** This retrieves the flight number, airline code, airline name, departure and arrival times, time elapsed, number of stops, and connections made.
- **JOINs:** The flight table is joined with the airline table to get the name of the airline based on its code.
- **WHERE Clauses:**
  - `F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SFO'` filters for flights departing from San Francisco International Airport.
  - `F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'` filters for flights arriving at Boston Logan International Airport.
  - `TIME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '11:59:59'` filters for flights that depart in the morning.
  - `TIME(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59'` filters for flights that arrive in the afternoon.
- **ORDER BY:** The results are ordered by departure time for easier reading.

Question: is there a flight from BOSTON to ATLANTA which leaves BOSTON in the afternoon and arrives close to 5pm
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a flight from Boston to Atlanta that leaves in the afternoon and arrives close to 5 PM, we first need to identify the airport codes for the two locations. Based on common airport codes, we'll assume the following:

- Boston's airport code is "BOS"
- Atlanta's airport code is "ATL"

Afternoon is generally considered to be between 12:00 PM (noon) and 5:59 PM, while arriving "close to 5 PM" could be interpreted as arriving between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM.

Here's the SQL query to find such flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59' AND
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '16:30:00' AND '17:30:00';
```

### Explanation:

- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve (airline code, flight, departure time, arrival time, flight ID, and flight number).
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Indicates the table from which to retrieve the data.
- `WHERE`: Filters the flights:
  - `F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS'`: Makes sure the flight departs from Boston.
  - `F.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'`: Ensures the flight arrives in Atlanta.
  - `F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59'`: Filters for flights that leave in the afternoon.
  - `F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '16:30:00' AND '17:30:00'`: Filters for flights that arrive close to 5 PM.

This query will return any flights from Boston to Atlanta that meet the specified conditions.

Question: can i get from DALLAS to SAN FRANCISCO leaving in the morning and arriving in the morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves flights from Dallas to San Francisco leaving in the morning and arriving in the morning, you will need to utilize the relevant tables and their relationships from your database schema. 

Assuming:
- The airport codes for Dallas and San Francisco are known (e.g., DFW for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and SFO for San Francisco International Airport).
- Morning is defined as departing between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM and arriving in the morning as before 12:00 PM.
- You need to join the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT table to get the relevant location information.

Here is an SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SAN FRANCISCO' AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 6 AND 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12 AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.ARRIVAL_TIME) < 12;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects flight number, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts from the FLIGHT table.
3. **JOINs**: Joins the AIRPORT table twice to link the departure and arrival airports.
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights leaving from Dallas (`A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS'`) and arriving at San Francisco (`A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SAN FRANCISCO'`).
   - Ensures that the departure time is in the defined morning range.
   - Ensures the arrival time is also before noon.

### Note:
- Make sure to adjust the airport codes per your actual data.
- The extraction of hours from the `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` assumes these fields are of a time type or compatible format; adjust if necessary based on your specific database system (for example, using DATE_FORMAT or similar functions in MySQL).
- You may also want to format the time display or handle time zones depending on your requirements and data structure.

Question: show me the flight that leaves PHILADELPHIA in the afternoon and arrives in the evening in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights that leave Philadelphia in the afternoon and arrive in Denver in the evening, you'll need to join the relevant tables and filter the results based on the flight times and the specific airports.

Assuming that the logical definitions of "afternoon" and "evening" are:
- Afternoon: 12:00 PM (noon) to 5:59 PM
- Evening: 6:00 PM to 11:59 PM

Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12 AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18  -- Afternoon
    AND HOUR(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= 18;  -- Evening
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight information from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Philadelphia) and once for the arrival airport (Denver).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the flights to:
  - Depart from Philadelphia
  - Arrive in Denver
  - Depart in the afternoon (between 12 PM and 5:59 PM)
  - Arrive in the evening (from 6 PM onward)

### Note:
Make sure to adjust the `HOUR()` function based on your SQL dialect as it may differ. Some databases might require you to extract the hour differently (like using `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME)` in PostgreSQL). Additionally, you may need to check if the `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME` fields are in the appropriate data type for this query to work properly.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for a flight from Boston to San Francisco that leaves in the afternoon and arrives in the evening, you'll need to join several tables including FLIGHT, AIRPORT, and DATE_DAY to filter the flights based on your criteria. Assuming we have the airport codes for Boston (BOS) and San Francisco (SFO), the SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 -- Afternoon (12 PM to 5 PM)
    AND HOUR(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 17 AND 21 -- Evening (5 PM to 9 PM)
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Notes:

1. Adjust `HOUR()` function according to your SQL dialect. Not all SQL databases support it. The calculation for `HOUR()` may need to be amended if using a timestamp.
2. The time brackets for departure and arrival can be modified based on the exact times you prefer for "afternoon" and "evening".
3. Make sure that 'BOSTON' and 'SAN FRANCISCO' correspond correctly to your `AIRPORT` table, or you may need to use their airport codes directly (like 'BOS' and 'SFO') depending on the schema details.
4. Ensure that the necessary time zone differences and flight durations (if relevant) are taken into account for accurate results.

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: We are selecting the flight ID, flight number, departure time, arrival time, and names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM**: The `FLIGHT` table is the primary table that contains the flight information.
3. **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get airport names for the departure (PHILADELPHIA) and arrival (DENVER) locations using the airport codes.
4. **WHERE**:
   - Filters flights that depart from `PHILADELPHIA`.
   - Filters flights that arrive in `DENVER`.
   - Sets the condition for the departure time to check if it is in the afternoon.
   - Sets the condition for the arrival time to ensure it is in the evening.

Make sure that the time formats in your database are compatible with the functions being used in the SQL query, and also review any date considerations if your data includes time zones. Adjust accordingly based on your actual schema compatibility.

Question: i want a flight from SAN FRANCISCO to DENVER leaving SAN FRANCISCO in the afternoon arriving DENVER around 5 in the afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get a flight from San Francisco to Denver, leaving in the afternoon and arriving in Denver around 5 PM, you would need to join the relevant tables in the database schema. The key tables for this query would likely be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `CITY` (if you want to retrieve city names for display).

Here's a SQL query that should fulfill your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER' AND 
    TIME(DATE_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%H:%i:%s')) BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:00:00' AND
    TIME(DATE_FORMAT(f.ARRIVAL_TIME, '%H:%i:%s')) BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '18:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects relevant details about the flight, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and airport names.

2. **Joins**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice—the first join selects the departure airport (San Francisco) and the second is for the arrival airport (Denver).

3. **Filters**:
   - The departure airport is filtered to match 'SAN FRANCISCO'.
   - The arrival airport is filtered to match 'DENVER'.
   - The departure time filter specifies flights that leave between 12:00 PM and 5:00 PM (i.e., afternoon).
   - The arrival time filter specifies flights that arrive around 5 PM (between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM).

4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the `DEPARTURE_TIME`, so the earliest afternoon flights appear first.

Please adjust the airport names as required if you're using exact codes or if the names are slightly different in the database.

Question: what is the earliest flight that i can get from BWI to BOS logan
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "BWI" AND AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = "BOS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = ( SELECT MIN( FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME ) FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias2 , AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias3 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE AIRPORTalias2.AIRPORT_CODE = "BWI" AND AIRPORTalias3.AIRPORT_CODE = "BOS" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias3.AIRPORT_CODE ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) to Boston Logan International (BOS), you would want to query the `FLIGHT` table for flights departing from BWI to BOS, and then sort the results by departure time to get the earliest flight. Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BWI' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, airline code, and airline name.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table (`F`) with the `AIRLINE` table (`A`) to obtain the airline name based on the `AIRLINE_CODE`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights where the origin is BWI and the destination is BOS.
- The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order.
- The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the earliest flight is returned. 

Make sure that the airport codes 'BWI' and 'BOS' are accurately represented in your `AIRPORT` table in case there are different codes used.

Question: what is the earliest flight between BOS and BWI
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "BOS" AND AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = "BWI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = ( SELECT MIN( FLIGHTalias1.DEPARTURE_TIME ) FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias2 , AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias3 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE AIRPORTalias2.AIRPORT_CODE = "BOS" AND AIRPORTalias3.AIRPORT_CODE = "BWI" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias3.AIRPORT_CODE ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight between Boston (BOS) and Baltimore/Washington (BWI), we can query the `FLIGHT` table looking for flights that have the specified departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`). We'll also need to retrieve the relevant details about the flight, including `DEPARTURE_TIME` to find the earliest flight. 

Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    AIRLINE_CODE 
FROM 
    FLIGHT 
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND 
    TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI' 
ORDER BY 
    DEPARTURE_TIME 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We're selecting the `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, and `AIRLINE_CODE` for better understanding of the flight.
- **FROM**: We are querying from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **WHERE**: This filters the results to only include flights that depart from `BOS` and arrive at `BWI`.
- **ORDER BY**: This ensures the results are sorted in ascending order by `DEPARTURE_TIME`, so the earliest flight is at the top.
- **LIMIT 1**: This restricts the output to only one result, which will be the earliest flight. 

Make sure that your database contains the relevant flight data for a successful run.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND ( FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the COACH fares for flights from Newark to Los Angeles departing after 1500 (3:00 PM), you’ll need to join several tables to get the required information. The relevant tables include `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `CITY`, and perhaps others depending on your database schema.

Here's an SQL query that should achieve this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
       F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
       F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
       FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
       FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FARE_FARE_ID FAID ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FAID.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FARE FA ON FAID.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
JOIN FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK'
  AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES'
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '15:00:00'  -- Time in 24-hour format for 3:00 PM
  AND FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'COACH';
```

### Explanation:
- Here, we select the relevant flight information and fare details.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` and `FARE_FARE_ID` tables to get the fare details for each flight.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table to identify the departure and arrival airport codes and then join the `CITY` table to filter based on the city names 'NEWARK' and 'LOS ANGELES'.
- We filter the results to fetch only those flights whose `DEPARTURE_TIME` is greater than 15:00:00.
- Finally, we ensure we are only fetching fares related to the 'COACH' class.

Make sure to adapt the column names, table structures, and data types as necessary based on your exact database schema implementation, particularly for time formats if needed.

Question: what NW flights stop in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights operated by Northwest Airlines (abbreviated as NW) that stop in Denver (identified by its airport code), you'll need to use a query that joins several tables in your database schema, particularly focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRLINE` tables. 

Here's an example SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    FS.STOP_AIRPORT, 
    FS.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    FS.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON FS.STOP_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'   -- Filter for Northwest Airlines
    AND A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver'  -- Assuming 'Denver' is part of the name; otherwise use AIRPORT_CODE for DEN
ORDER BY 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER;
```

### Notes:
1. Make sure to replace `A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver'` with the corresponding airport identification if necessary, including using `AIRPORT_CODE` if `DEN` is the airport code for Denver.
2. The `FLIGHT` table links to the `FLIGHT_STOP` table, which allows checking the stops for each flight.
3. The `AIRPORT` table provides the relevant details about the airports involved.
4. Confirm that 'NW' is the correct airline code for Northwest Airlines (it is historically correct; check your CODE_DESCRIPTION if needed).

Question: what UA flights go through DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the United Airlines (UA) flights that go through Denver, you will need to join several tables to get the relevant information. Here’s a SQL query that will provide you the details of flights operated by United Airlines that either depart from or arrive at a Denver airport:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' AND 
    (A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%DENVER%' OR A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%DENVER%');
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **SELECT Statement**: We're selecting relevant flight information such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, and times.

2. **FROM and JOIN Clauses**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport) to get more details about both locations.

3. **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results to include only flights operated by United Airlines (denoted by its airline code 'UA') and check if either the departure or arrival airport is in Denver.

Make sure to replace `AIRPORT_LOCATION` with the actual column that represents the airport's location data in the `AIRPORT` table, should it differ in your schema.

Question: which UA flights go through DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find United Airlines (UA) flights that go through Denver, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights where the departure or arrival airport is Denver. We will first need to identify the airport code for Denver and then filter the flights based on that code.

Here’s the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
-- First, let's find the airport code for Denver
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Den%' OR CITY_NAME LIKE '%Denver%';

-- Assuming the airport code for Denver is 'DEN', you can use the following query
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'
AND (FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' OR TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN');
```

In the first part of the query, we are selecting the `AIRPORT_CODE` of Denver from the `AIRPORT` table, which contains the airport codes and names. You should replace the placeholder in the second query once the actual code for Denver is retrieved.

Assuming that the airport code for Denver is 'DEN', the second part of the query selects all flights from the `FLIGHT` table with the following conditions:
- The `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'UA' (for United Airlines).
- Either the `FROM_AIRPORT` or `TO_AIRPORT` is 'DEN'.

Make sure the `AIRPORT_CODE` is confirmed to be 'DEN' based on your findings from the first query.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

Question: all NW flights with stopovers in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all Northwest (NW) flights with stopovers in Denver, you need to join various tables to find relevant flight information. The tables of interest based on your schema are `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` to ensure you have the right airport in Denver.

According to the schema provided, the attributes in the `FLIGHT` table will allow you to identify the airline flights, and the `FLIGHT_STOP` table will provide the stopover information.

The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP AS fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS a ON fs.STOP_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW' -- Northwest Airlines code
    AND a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'; -- Assuming 'DENVER' is the location for Denver Airport
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: This selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, stop airport, and stop time.
2. **FROM Clause**: Identifies the `FLIGHT` table alias as `f`.
3. **JOINs**:
   - The `FLIGHT_STOP` table is joined to get stopover details for each flight.
   - The `AIRPORT` table is joined to check if the stopover is in Denver.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results for flights operated by Northwest (using the presumed airline code 'NW') and with stopovers at Denver.

Make sure to replace `'NW'` with the actual airline code for Northwest if it differs, and ensure that the condition for identifying Denver in the `AIRPORT` table matches your database setup. If 'DENVER' is not stored directly in the `AIRPORT_LOCATION`, you might need to use another reference like `AIRPORT_NAME`.

Question: all UA flights with stopovers in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all United Airlines (UA) flights with stopovers in Denver, we need to join several tables, including `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, and any relevant filtering criteria.

Here’s an SQL query that should accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_TIME,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    fs.STOP_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON fs.STOP_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' -- United Airlines
    AND a.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DENVER%' -- Stopover in Denver
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table and the `FLIGHT_STOP` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to the `FLIGHT` table on the `FLIGHT_ID` to get flight details and stop details.
- We then join the `AIRPORT` table to filter based on the airport name (Denver).
- We filter for United Airlines flights by specifying `f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'`.
- Finally, we order the results by departure time for better readability.

Ensure that the airport name and codes are correctly matched according to your database. You may need to adjust the `LIKE` condition or other parameters based on the exact naming conventions in your database.

Question: what NW flights stop in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves flights from the `FLIGHT` table that are operated by "Northwest Airlines" and have a stop in Denver, you would typically need to refer to the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to check for any stops at the Denver airport. Assuming that the airport code for Denver is known (it's typically "DEN"), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT, 
    fs.STOP_NUMBER
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'  -- Assuming 'NW' is the code for Northwest Airlines
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DEN';  -- Assuming 'DEN' is the airport code for Denver
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause specifies the fields to retrieve from the result set, including the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and details about stops.
- The `FROM` clause identifies the main table we're querying from (`FLIGHT`) and specifies a join with `FLIGHT_STOP` to get the stop information.
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables based on the `FLIGHT_ID`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights operated by Northwest Airlines (using an example code 'NW' here) that have a stop at Denver (IDs are specified as 'DEN'). 

Be sure to adjust the airline code and airport code based on your actual data if they are different.

Question: NW flights with stops in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about Northwest (NW) flights with stops in Denver from the provided database schema, you would typically join the relevant tables together to find flights operated by Northwest Airlines that have a stop in Denver. Below is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    f.TO_AIRPORT, 
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT, 
    fs.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    fs.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'  -- Assuming 'NW' is the airline code for Northwest Airlines
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DEN';  -- Assuming 'DEN' is the airport code for Denver
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We select flight details, including the flight ID, flight number, from airport, to airport, stop airport, arrival time, and departure time.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table (`f`) and the `FLIGHT_STOP` table (`fs`) on their `FLIGHT_ID`.
- We filter the results where the airline code is 'NW' (indicating Northwest Airlines) and where the stop airport is 'DEN' (indicating Denver).

Make sure to adjust the airline code if it differs from what is provided in the schema or the query context.

Raw LLM Response:
To find United Airlines (UA) flights that go through Denver, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table and filter for flights that have the airport code for Denver in either the departure airport or the arrival airport. Typically, the airport code for Denver International Airport is "DEN". Here’s the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
  AND (FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' OR TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN');
```

This query selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'UA' (for United Airlines) and where either the `FROM_AIRPORT` or `TO_AIRPORT` is 'DEN' (indicating the flight goes through Denver).

Question: UA stopping in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves information about United Airlines (UA) flights stopping in Denver (with the airport code typically being "DEN" for Denver International Airport), we would need to join multiple tables to include relevant details such as flight number, departure and arrival times, and possibly other related information.

Here’s an example of an SQL query that retrieves flight information related to United Airlines with a stop in Denver:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOP.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
    AND FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DEN';
```

### Explanation:
- **Selected Columns**: The query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables.
- **JOIN Clause**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table and the `FLIGHT_STOP` table on `FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID` to filter through flights that have stops.
- **WHERE Clause**: It filters the results to include only flights where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'UA' (for United Airlines) and where the `STOP_AIRPORT` is 'DEN' (denoting a stop in Denver).

### Note
- Ensure the actual airport code for Denver is accurate (which is typically 'DEN' for Denver International Airport).
  
You can customize the query further based on additional requirements or fields you may need based on the database schema provided.

Question: UA flights stopping in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about United Airlines (UA) flights that stop in Denver, you will need to query the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `AIRPORT` tables using the appropriate joins. Assuming that "DENVER" corresponds to a specific airport code in the `AIRPORT` table, you will first need to identify that airport code.

Here’s an SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_TIME,
    a.AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON fs.STOP_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA'  -- United Airlines code
    AND a.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DENVER%'  -- Assuming 'DENVER' is part of the airport name
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder for the airport code with the actual code if needed. The `LIKE '%DENVER%'` clause is used to ensure that we match any variations in the airport name that include "DENVER". If you know the exact airport code for Denver (for example, `DEN` for Denver International Airport), you can use that instead:

```sql
AND a.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN'
``` 

This SQL query retrieves details about all UA flights that have Denver as a stop, including the flight number, departure time, arrival time, stop airport, and stop time.

Question: show me the flights on DL that go through ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights on Delta Airlines (DL) that go through Atlanta (ATL), you will need to join the relevant tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and possibly `AIRPORT`. The following SQL query retrieves this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    a.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
    AND (fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL');
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns we want to see in the result: flight ID, flight number, departure time, arrival time, from and to airports, and the airline name.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names based on their codes.
- We also join `FLIGHT_STOP` to check stops.
- The `WHERE` clause filters records to only include those where the airline code is 'DL' (Delta Airlines) and checks if the flight either departs from or arrives at ATL (or has ATL as a stop).

Make sure to adapt the SQL if your database requires any specific adjustments based on naming conventions or schema specifics.

Question: can you please tell me the type of aircraft used flying from ATLANTA to DENVER on EA flight 825 leaving at 555
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "EA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the type of aircraft used for the EA flight 825 leaving from Atlanta to Denver at 5:55, we will need to execute a SQL query that joins several tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRCRAFT`, and `AIRPORT` (to get airport codes). Below is an example SQL query that retrieves the aircraft type used for that specific flight:

```sql
SELECT A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, A.MANUFACTURER, A.BASIC_TYPE 
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRCRAFT A ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN AIRPORT AS AP_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS AP_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'EA' 
  AND F.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 825 
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME = '05:55'
  AND AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CITY = 'ATLANTA'
  AND AP_TO.AIRPORT_CITY = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:
- **SELECT**: We are selecting fields from the `AIRCRAFT` table to get the details about the aircraft type used.
- **JOIN**:
  - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table to get the aircraft details corresponding to the flight.
  - We also join the `AIRPORT` table twice to verify the departure and arrival airports.
- **WHERE**: We filter the results based on the specific flight details: airline, flight number, departure time, and airport criteria.

### Important Note:
- Ensure that the conditions in the `WHERE` clause match how the airports are defined in the `AIRPORT` table, as the query uses a placeholder for the city name. If you have an `AIRPORT_CODE` for `ATLANTA` and `DENVER`, you should directly use those codes.
- This query assumes that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in a format that allows for direct comparison, like a `TIME` or `VARCHAR` string. If stored in a different format (like `DATETIME`), additional conversion may be required.

Question: EA flight 825 from ATLANTA to DENVER leaving at 555 what type of aircraft is used on that flight
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "EA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the type of aircraft used for the flight EA 825 from Atlanta to Denver leaving at 5:55, you will need to join relevant tables from the database schema. The required information can be gathered from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `AIRCRAFT`, and potentially other related tables.

Below is an SQL query that can retrieve the type of aircraft for the specified flight:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, 
    A.MANUFACTURER, 
    A.BASIC_TYPE 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT A ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_A ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'EA'
    AND F.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '825'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME = '05:55'
    AND FROM_A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA'
    AND TO_A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects the aircraft description, manufacturer, and basic type from the `AIRCRAFT` table.
2. It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table on `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`.
3. It also joins the `AIRPORT` table for both the departure and arrival airports to confirm that the flight is from Atlanta to Denver.
4. It filters the results for the specified airline code ('EA'), flight number ('825'), departure time ('05:55'), and the relevant airports.

This will return the aircraft details for the specified flight. Make sure that your database has the relevant data and the columns used in the joins match those defined in your schema.

Question: what flights leave SEATTLE on sunday on CO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that leave Seattle on Sunday with the airline code "CO" (which typically represents Continental Airlines), you would need to join the relevant tables based on their relationships while filtering for flights departing from Seattle (let's assume the airport code for Seattle is "SEA"). 

The relevant tables for this query include FLIGHT, AIRLINE, DAYS, and AIRPORT. Here's a SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    AP.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SEA' AND  -- Assuming 'SEA' is the airport code for Seattle
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday' AND
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO';  -- Filtering for Continental Airlines
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT (F)**: Contains flight details including **FROM_AIRPORT**.
- **AIRLINE (A)**: Provides the name of the airline using **AIRLINE_CODE**.
- **DAYS (D)**: Contains a list of days and their respective codes, with condition filtering for Sunday.
- **AIRPORT (AP)**: Filters the flights that depart from Seattle.

Make sure to replace 'SEA' with the actual airport code for Seattle if it differs in your database. This query assumes that 'CO' corresponds to Continental Airlines and that the relevant day code for Sunday is correctly matched in your DAYS table.

Question: list all flights on CO leaving DENVER on monday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights operated by airline code 'CO' leaving from Denver on Mondays, you will need to join several tables since the relevant information is spread across multiple entities in the schema. Assuming 'DENVER' corresponds to the appropriate airport code in the `AIRPORT` table, you would first need to determine the airport code for Denver (let's assume it's 'DEN' for this example). You'll also need to join with the `FLIGHT`, `DAYS`, and potentially other tables to ensure the day condition is applied correctly.

Here’s an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO'
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Monday';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Clause**: We're selecting various fields that can provide detail about the flight, such as flight number, departure and arrival times, and the airline code.
- **FROM Clause**: The main table being queried is `FLIGHT`.
- **JOIN Clause**: We join the `DAYS` table to filter based on the day of the week.
- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - We ensure that the flight is operated by 'CO'.
  - We filter the flights that are leaving from 'DEN' (Denver).
  - Lastly, we check that the day of the flight corresponds to 'Monday'.

### Note:
- Replace `'DEN'` with the actual airport code for Denver if it's different in your dataset.
- Ensure that the field names such as `FLIGHT_DAYS` in the `FLIGHT` table and `DAYS_CODE` in the `DAYS` table match appropriately as per your schema definition.

    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,

    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS

    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO'
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Monday';

Question: list all flights leaving DENVER on CO on sunday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights leaving Denver (DEN) on United Airlines (CO) on Sunday, you would typically need to join several tables in your database: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and `FLIGHT_DAYS` to filter by the relevant airports, days of the week, and airlines.

Here’s how you would construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    a.AIRLINE_NAME, 
    ap.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    c.CITY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = ap.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c ON ap.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS fd ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fd.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fd.DAYS_CODE = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
    AND a.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: We're selecting relevant columns that provide information about the flights, including flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, the airline name, airport name, and city name.

2. **FROM Clause**: We're starting from the `FLIGHT` table since that's where we get the flight details.

3. **JOIN Clauses**:
   - Join `AIRLINE` to get airline details.
   - Join `AIRPORT` to filter based on the departure airport which is Denver.
   - Join `CITY` to ensure we are looking specifically at Denver.
   - Join `FLIGHT_DAYS` to filter flights by the days they operate.
   - Join `DAYS` to specifically select Sunday.

4. **WHERE Clause**: It filters results where the city is Denver, the airline code is CO, and the day of the week is Sunday.

Make sure that the city and airport codes for Denver and the airline codes used in the query match those present in your database.

SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To get all the flights from Denver to Atlanta along with their fare details, you need to join several tables. You'll be looking at the `FLIGHT` table for the flight information, the `FARE` table for the fare information, and the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to connect the two.

The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID 
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND      -- Assuming 'DEN' is the airport code for Denver
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL';            -- Assuming 'ATL' is the airport code for Atlanta
```

In this query:
- We select the relevant flight details (like flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, stops) and fare details (one-way and round-trip cost).
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table using the `FLIGHT_ID`, which is common between them through the `FLIGHT_FARE` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from Denver (DEN) to Atlanta (ATL).

Make sure to replace `'DEN'` and `'ATL'` with the correct airport codes if they differ in your database schema.

SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights and fares from Dallas to San Francisco, you will need to join multiple tables in your schema. You'll typically want to get the details from the `FLIGHT` table for the flight information and the `FARE` table for fare details. 

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.FARE_ID,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DALLAS%')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SAN FRANCISCO%');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Required Fields**: The SELECT statement retrieves the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, from and to airport codes, fare ID, and costs.
2. **FROM Clause**: Signals that we are pulling data from the `FLIGHT` table aliased as `f`.
3. **JOIN**: Combines the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table based on their relationship using `FLIGHT_ID`.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to include only flights departing from any airport in Dallas to any airport in San Francisco. The sub-queries fetch the appropriate airport codes based on their names.

This query assumes there might be multiple airports that fit the descriptions in Dallas and San Francisco, hence the use of the sub-queries. If you need to specify particular airports or require additional details, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Kansas City to Cleveland along with their prices, we need to join the relevant tables based on the relationships defined in your schema. Specifically, we'll be focusing on the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. 

Here’s a SQL query that will return the necessary information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    CITY C_FROM
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON C_FROM.CITY_CODE = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F ON A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND'
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON C_TO.CITY_CODE = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY'
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **Selection of Columns**: We're selecting the flight number, departure and arrival times, as well as the one-way and round-trip costs from the associated tables.

2. **Joining Tables**:
   - First, we join the `CITY` table for Kansas City to the `AIRPORT` table to get the associated airport code.
   - We then join `FLIGHT` to find flights departing from that airport.
   - The `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables are joined to get the pricing information for those flights.
   - Finally, we join the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` for Cleveland to ensure that we are only retrieving flights that are arriving there.

3. **Filtering Flights**: The `WHERE` clause specifies that we only want flights departing from Kansas City to Cleveland.

### Note:
- Make sure the actual names of the airports and other details are in accordance with how they are stored in your database.
- Ensure that the `Cleveland` city name aligns with how it is represented in your `CITY` table, as there can be multiple locations that have similar names.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver to Philadelphia, along with their associated fares, you will need to join multiple tables in your SQL query. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    a.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT denver ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = denver.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT philadelphia ON f.TO_AIRPORT = philadelphia.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    denver.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver International Airport' 
    AND philadelphia.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Philadelphia International Airport';
```

In this query:
- We retrieve relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table (`FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`) as well as `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` from the `FARE` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Denver) and once for the arrival airport (Philadelphia).
- We also join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare details and the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name.

You'll need to ensure that the airport names in the `WHERE` clause are correctly specified based on your database entries for Denver and Philadelphia. Adjust the airport names as necessary to match the values in your `AIRPORT` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fare and flight information from Baltimore to Philadelphia using the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the relevant tables to get flight details, including the fares associated with those flights.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,

    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA');
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects various flight and fare details.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table using the flight ID.
- It uses subqueries to find the airport codes for Baltimore and Philadelphia based on their names.
- Make sure the names used in the subqueries accurately reflect the names in the `AIRPORT` table. You may need to adjust this depending on the actual entries in your database.
- If you want additional information (like airline name, airport locations, etc.), you can join more tables accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights and their corresponding fares from Denver to Oakland, we'll need to join several tables to get the relevant information, including flight details and fare costs. Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this by joining the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and other necessary tables.

Assuming the airport codes for Denver and Oakland are 'DEN' and 'OAK' respectively, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    FA.FARE_ID,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FA.FARE_AIRLINE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'OAK';
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `F`): Contains the basic information about the flights.
- `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `A1` and `A2`): Used twice to get the names of the departure (Denver) and arrival (Oakland) airports.
- `FLIGHT_FARE` table (aliased as `FF`): Links flights to their corresponding fares.
- `FARE` table (aliased as `FA`): Contains the fare details such as costs and restrictions.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the records to only show flights departing from Denver to Oakland.

Make sure to validate the airport codes for Denver and Oakland as they might differ based on the database's data.

Question: show me all flights from ATLANTA to WASHINGTON with prices
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Atlanta to Washington along with their prices, you'll need to join the relevant tables in your database. In this case, you will primarily deal with the `FLIGHT` table to get the flight information, and the `FARE` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to get the pricing details. You will typically identify which airports correspond to Atlanta and Washington.

You will likely need the airport codes for Atlanta (ATL) and Washington (DCA or IAD, depending on which airport you want to consider). Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT IN ('DCA', 'IAD')
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the query:
- **SELECT** clause: Specifies the columns to return, including flight details and prices.
- **FROM** clause: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table (alias "F").
- **JOIN** clauses: 
  - Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table (alias "FF") to associate flights with their fares.
  - Joins the `FARE` table (alias "FA") to get pricing information.
- **WHERE** clause: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Atlanta (ATL) and arriving at either Washington DCA or IAD.
- **ORDER BY** clause: Sorts the result set by the flight departure time.

Make sure to replace 'DCA' and 'IAD' based on your specific requirement for the Washington airport, and ensure that the records actually exist with those codes in the relevant tables.

Question: show all flights and fares from PITTSBURGH to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights and fares from Pittsburgh to San Francisco using the provided database schema, you would need to join several relevant tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, and `FLIGHT_FARE`. Below is a sample SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `f`).
- **JOINs**: 
  - `AIRPORT` is joined twice: once to filter for the departure airport (Pittsburgh) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
  - `FLIGHT_FARE` is joined to link the flights with their respective fare information.
  - `FARE` is joined to get detailed fare information such as cost and restrictions.
- **WHERE clause**: It specifies the conditions to only include flights from Pittsburgh to San Francisco.

Make sure that the names used in the `AIRPORT_NAME` match exactly with the entries in your database. If the airport codes (not names) are known, it is more efficient to filter by `AIRPORT_CODE`.

Question: fares and flights from DENVER to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares and flights from Denver to Philadelphia using the provided database schema, you can use a SQL query that joins multiple tables to get the necessary information. The query below assumes that you have relevant data in the tables and that the airport codes for Denver and Philadelphia are known.

Here's an example SQL query for fetching fares and flight details:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
    JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
    JOIN FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHILADELPHIA';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight details, including the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and fare information.
- It joins the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to link flights with their corresponding fare information.
- It filters based on the airport locations for Denver and Philadelphia.

### Note:
- Update the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` filtering conditions to match the appropriate column where the airport location is defined, like `AIRPORT_CODE` if airport codes are utilized rather than locations.
- Ensure the correct conditions are applied based on the actual values in your database schema for Denver and Philadelphia airport codes (e.g., `DEN` for Denver International Airport and `PHL` for Philadelphia International Airport). If you have the airport codes already defined, use them in the `WHERE` clause accordingly:

```sql
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'  -- replace with actual code
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHL'; -- replace with actual code
``` 

Adjust the query as necessary to accommodate your exact table structure and naming conventions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights with fares from Pittsburgh (PIT) to San Francisco (SFO), you can apply a SQL query that joins the relevant tables based on their relationships. The tables you will primarily use are `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO';
```

### Explanation:
- **`SELECT` clause**: This specifies the columns you'd like to retrieve: the flight ID, flight number, departure time, arrival time, and fare information (one-direction and round-trip costs).
- **`FROM` clause**: Specifies the main table `FLIGHT` to query from.
- **`JOIN` statements**: These join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get the fare details associated with each flight.
- **`WHERE` clause**: This filters results to only include flights departing from Pittsburgh (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT'`) and arriving in San Francisco (`TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'`). 

Make sure you have the appropriate permissions and the environment ready for executing this SQL query.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of all the flights between Dallas and Baltimore along with their costs, you can use the following SQL query. This query joins the necessary tables to gather the information about flights, including details about departure and arrival airports, and their corresponding fares.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'DALLAS' AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'BALTIMORE';
```

This SQL query performs the following actions:

1. **Selects Columns**: It specifies the columns that should be included in the output, such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and fare costs.

2. **Joins Tables**:
   - It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get information about the departure airport (Dallas) and the arrival airport (Baltimore) based on their airport codes.
   - It also joins the `FARE` table to get cost information associated with each flight.

3. **Filters Results**: The `WHERE` clause filters the flights to include only those where the departure airport matches Dallas and the destination airport matches Baltimore.

Make sure to replace `'DALLAS'` and `'BALTIMORE'` with the actual `CITY_CODE` values for Dallas and Baltimore if those are available in the `CITY` table. If you need the corresponding city codes from the `CITY` table, add an additional join on that table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights and fares from Denver to San Francisco, we will need to join several tables such as `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`. The joining criteria will be based on the relevant keys.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fare.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'    -- Assuming 'DEN' is the airport code for Denver
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'; -- Assuming 'SFO' is the airport code for San Francisco
```

In this query:
- We select fields from the `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE` table based on the `FLIGHT_ID`.
- We filter for flights where the departure airport is Denver (assuming the code is 'DEN') and the destination airport is San Francisco (assuming the code is 'SFO').

Make sure to replace 'DEN' and 'SFO' with the actual airport codes you use in your database if they are different.

Question: show fares and flights from DENVER to OAKLAND
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares and flights from Denver to Oakland, we will need to join the relevant tables together based on the provided schema. Specifically, we will join the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly supplementary tables like `FLIGHT_FARE` to properly correlate the fares with their respective flights.

Assuming "DENVER" and "OAKLAND" correspond to specific airport codes (let's assume "DEN" for Denver International Airport and "OAK" for Oakland International Airport), the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver International Airport' AND  -- Adjust to the actual name if different
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Oakland International Airport';     -- Adjust to the actual name if different
```

In this query:
- We select relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table to the `FLIGHT_FARE` table using `FLIGHT_ID`.
- We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to the `FARE` table using `FARE_ID`.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the information for both the departure and arrival airports based on their codes.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights that depart from Denver and arrive in Oakland.

Make sure to replace the airport names in the `WHERE` clause with the exact names as they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table, or, alternatively, you can use their respective codes if you have them.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights and fares from Denver to San Francisco, you'll need to join several tables in your database schema. You'll specifically need to join the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and possibly the `AIRPORT` table to get the relevant airport codes for Denver and San Francisco. 

Here's a sample SQL query that demonstrates this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT dep_airport ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = dep_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT arr_airport ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = arr_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    dep_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver' AND
    arr_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the fields you want to retrieve (flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and fare details).
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Selects from the `FLIGHT` table and gives it an alias `f`.
- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID**: Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the fare information associated with each flight.
- **JOIN FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID**: Joins the `FARE` table to access fare details.
- **JOIN AIRPORT** statements are used to link the fare's from and to airport codes with their respective airport names.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from Denver and arriving in San Francisco.

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport names 'Denver' and 'San Francisco' are accurate as per your `AIRPORT` table. You might need to use airport codes (like DEN for Denver International Airport and SFO for San Francisco International Airport) if they are more suitable for your database design. 

If you want to use airport codes instead, this part of the query would change to reference the relevant airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights and fares from Atlanta to Philadelphia using the provided database schema, we need to join the relevant tables that contain information about flights and fares, specifically filtering for the departure airport (Atlanta) and destination airport (Philadelphia).

Here’s the SQL query you would use to get that information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FL.FARE_ID,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE_FAIR FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA')
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA');
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: This specifies the columns we want to retrieve: flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, fare ID, and both one-way and round-trip costs.

2. **FROM Clause**: We start with the `FLIGHT` table which contains the basic flight information.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the fare associated with each flight, and then with the `FARE` table to get the cost details.

4. **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results to include only flights that depart from Atlanta and arrive in Philadelphia. To get the airport codes for Atlanta and Philadelphia, we use subqueries on the `AIRPORT` table based on the airport names.

Make sure to replace `'ATLANTA'` and `'PHILADELPHIA'` with the actual airport names as they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights with fares from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, you will need to join several tables to gather the necessary information. The relevant tables include `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly others depending on what specific details you want (e.g., flight times, aircraft details).

Here's a sample SQL query that should return the desired flights along with their fares:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight numbers, departure and arrival times, and fare costs from `FLIGHT`.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Pittsburgh) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
- It joins `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get the fare details for the flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to only include flights departing from Pittsburgh and arriving in San Francisco.

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` values if your schema uses different names for these airports.

Question: what are the flights and fares from BOSTON to PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE , FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights and fares from Boston to Philadelphia, you would need to join multiple tables that contain relevant information about flights, airfare, airports, and other related data. Assuming that "BOSTON" and "PHILADELPHIA" refer to the city names in the `CITY` table, you first need to find the `CITY_CODE` for both cities. Then, you'll need to locate the corresponding `AIRPORT_CODE` from the `AIRPORT` table and finally join this information to fetch flight details and their associated fares.

Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY city_from ON a_from.AIRPORT_LOCATION = city_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY city_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_LOCATION = city_to.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    city_from.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    AND city_to.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA';
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting various columns to get flight details along with fare information.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` to get the airport names for both the origin and destination.
- The fare details are joined using the `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table and `FARE` table.
- We further join with the `CITY` table to filter records for Boston and Philadelphia based on their `CITY_NAME`.

Ensure that the field names and relationships are correctly enforced according to your database schema before executing this query. Adjustments may be needed if there are differences in how data is structured.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares and flights from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia using the provided database schema, you can perform a SQL query that joins several tables, mainly focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and potentially other relevant tables like `AIRPORT` and `FLIGHT_FARE`. The query will ensure that the departure and arrival airports match the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia codes.

Here’s a potential SQL query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FA.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Pittsburgh'
AND 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Philadelphia';
```

In this query:

- We select the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, number of stops, as well as fare information (one direction cost, round trip cost, and restriction code).
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter flights out of Pittsburgh and into Philadelphia based on the airport names.
- We also join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to get fare details related to those flights.

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` filtering according to how the airport records are exactly named in your database if the names differ. If you need more details from other tables, you can include those as needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights and their associated costs for all airlines flying from Denver (DEN) to Baltimore (BWI), you need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and possibly `AIRLINE` for the airline details. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE AS A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI';
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT**: This clause indicates the columns to retrieve: airline code, airline name, flight number, one-way cost, and round-trip cost.
- **FROM FLIGHT AS F**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table and gives it an alias `F` for easier referencing.
- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE AS FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID**: Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to match flight IDs to their corresponding fares.
- **JOIN FARE AS FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID**: Joins the `FARE` table to get the fare information for each flight.
- **JOIN AIRLINE AS A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE**: Joins the `AIRLINE` table to retrieve airline names.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights from Denver (DEN) to Baltimore (BWI).

Make sure that the airport codes (`DEN` for Denver and `BWI` for Baltimore) are correct according to your database. Adjust them if your system uses different codes.

AND F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO' 
AND FS.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT** table is joined with the **FLIGHT_STOP** table to get details of any stopovers.
2. The **AIRCRAFT** table is joined using the **AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE** in the **FLIGHT** table to retrieve aircraft details.
3. The **FARE** table is used to filter the flights that are in the FIRST class, and it's joined with the **FARE_BASIS** table to check the booking class.
4. The query filters based on:
   - The airline code to be 'AA'
   - The departure airport to be 'PHILADELPHIA'
   - The destination airport to be 'SAN FRANCISCO'
   - The stopover airport to be 'DALLAS'
5. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to avoid duplicate results for different aircraft. 

Make sure to adjust the values in the query according to the exact airport codes used in your database, if 'PHILADELPHIA', 'SAN FRANCISCO', and 'DALLAS' are not the exact values in the **AIRPORT** table.

Raw LLM Response:
To find out the kind of aircraft used on the first-class American Airlines (AA) flight from Philadelphia (PHL) to San Francisco (SFO) that stops in Dallas (DFW), you will need to join several tables in the database schema.

The query will involve the following steps:
1. Identify the flight from PHILADELPHIA to SAN FRANCISCO that includes a stop in DALLAS.
2. Join the necessary tables to retrieve the aircraft information used for that flight, specifically focusing on the first-class service.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRCRAFT_CODE,
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    A.MANUFACTURER,
    A.BASIC_TYPE,
    A.ENGINES,
    A.PROPULSION,
    A.WIDE_BODY,
    A.WING_SPAN,
    A.LENGTH,

    A.RANGE_MILES,

    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT A ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = E.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHL' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO' AND
    FS.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DFW' AND
    FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F' AND       -- Assuming 'F' represents First class
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
ORDER BY 
    F.FLIGHT_ID
LIMIT 1; -- Assuming we're looking only for the first flight based on the FLIGHT_ID
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the aircraft details from the `AIRCRAFT` table.
- We join with the `FLIGHT` table to get the relevant flight information, associated with the aircraft.
- We further join with `FLIGHT_STOP` to ensure the flight stops in Dallas (DFW).
- We also join with `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` to filter for first-class tickets.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures we specify the origin (PHL), destination (SFO), and adds the condition for first-class (assuming it corresponds to booking class 'F').
- We limit the result to just one result, considered the first available flight. 

Make sure to replace 'F' in `FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F'` with the correct code used for First-class if it varies in the actual dataset.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine the type of aircraft you'll be flying based on your criteria (departure from Philadelphia (PHL) to San Francisco (SFO), flying first class with American Airlines (AA), and having a stop in Dallas (DFW)), we can write an SQL query that will join the relevant tables in the database schema you've provided.

Here’s an SQL query to retrieve the relevant aircraft details:

    AND FA.FARE_AIRLINE = 'AA' 
    AND FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = (SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE FROM FARE_BASIS WHERE BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST');
```

### Explanation of the query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We're selecting the aircraft details from the AIRCRAFT table.
2. **JOIN Clauses**: We're joining the FLIGHT, FLIGHT_STOP, FLIGHT_FARE, and FARE tables to be able to filter the flights right.
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - We're ensuring that:
     - The flight departs from Philadelphia (`F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHL'`),
     - The destination is San Francisco (`F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'`), 
     - There is a stop in Dallas (`FS.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DFW'`), 
     - The airline is American Airlines (`FA.FARE_AIRLINE = 'AA'`), 
     - The fare basis corresponds to first class.

Make sure that table relationships and primary key references in your schema are correctly defined to execute this query effectively.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest departure time from Boston to Denver, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table and join it with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for the specific origin and destination airports. The SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS EARLIEST_DEPARTURE
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

Note:
- This query assumes that you have the correct airport names available in the `AIRPORT` table.
- If the airport names for Boston and Denver are more specific (e.g., "Boston Logan International Airport" and "Denver International Airport"), ensure to use the correct names based on your database entries.
- The `MIN()` function retrieves the earliest departure time from the results.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Washington to Philadelphia, you need to join several tables based on the relationships defined in your schema. Specifically, you will need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter the flights based on departure and arrival airports, and then order the results to find the earliest flight.

Assuming "Washington" refers to one of the airports in Washington (for example, DCA, IAD, or BWI) and "Philadelphia" refers to the airport in Philadelphia (PHL), the following SQL query will return the earliest flight:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%WASHINGTON%' AND 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%PHILADELPHIA%'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: We choose the fields we want to see in the result - flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: We are querying the `FLIGHT` table and giving it an alias `F`.
- `JOIN`: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - `A_FROM` to find the departure airport.
  - `A_TO` to find the arrival airport.
- `WHERE`: We filter the records:
  - `A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%WASHINGTON%'` ensures we only consider flights departing from Washington.
  - `A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%PHILADELPHIA%'` ensures we only consider flights arriving in Philadelphia.
- `ORDER BY F.DEPARTURE_TIME`: This will sort the results by departure time, with the earliest flights first.
- `LIMIT 1`: This selects only the earliest flight from the sorted results.

Make sure to replace `%WASHINGTON%` and `%PHILADELPHIA%` with the actual airport names if necessary, and confirm that the airport codes (e.g., DCA, IAD, PHL) are correctly used.

Question: what time does the earliest flight which goes from ATLANTA to DENVER leave
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the time of the earliest flight that goes from Atlanta to Denver, you would need to join several tables to gather the relevant information. You should look for flights departing from Atlanta (ATL) and arriving in Denver (DEN), and then find the minimum departure time.

Here's an SQL query that finds the earliest departure time for flights from Atlanta (ATL) to Denver (DEN):

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS EARLIEST_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the minimum (`MIN()`) departure time from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - `a1` is for the departure airport (Atlanta).
  - `a2` is for the destination airport (Denver).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights whose departure airport is Atlanta and arrival airport is Denver.

Make sure to adjust `a1.AIRPORT_NAME` and `a2.AIRPORT_NAME` as necessary to match the exact names used in your database if they differ. If the airport codes are instead used, you may need to use `a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ATL'` and `a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN'`.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT MIN(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS EARLIEST_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ATLANTA' AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER';

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Boston to Denver, you can use the following SQL query. Assuming that "BOSTON" corresponds to the appropriate airport code (which I'll assume is "BOS" for Boston Logan International Airport) and "DENVER" corresponds to the appropriate airport code (which I'll assume is "DEN" for Denver International Airport), the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    AIRLINE_CODE, 
    DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    CONNECTIONS, 
    STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND 
    TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
ORDER BY 
    DEPARTURE_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` statement retrieves the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, connections, and stops.
- The `FROM` clause specifies the `FLIGHT` table, which contains flight details.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only flights departing from Boston (assumed code 'BOS') to Denver (assumed code 'DEN').
- The `ORDER BY DEPARTURE_TIME ASC` sorts the results by departure time in ascending order (earliest first).
- The `LIMIT 1` restricts the output to only the earliest flight.

Make sure to adjust the airport codes if needed based on your specific data.

Raw LLM Response:
To query the first flight leaving from Oakland to Boston, you would typically need to join multiple tables to get the relevant flight information, including departure times, airport codes, and possibly the airline details. Assuming that the airport codes for Oakland and Boston are known (for example, OAK for Oakland and BOS for Boston), the SQL query can be structured as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK' AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- `SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, f.AIRLINE_CODE`: This selects the flight number, departure time, and airline code of the flights.
- `FROM FLIGHT f`: This indicates we are pulling data from the `FLIGHT` table, aliased as `f`.
- `WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK' AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'`: This filters the flights to only include those departing from Oakland and arriving in Boston.
- `ORDER BY f.DEPARTURE_TIME ASC`: This sorts the results by the departure time in ascending order, so the earliest flight comes first.
- `LIMIT 1`: This limits the return result to only the first (earliest) flight.

Ensure that the airport codes ('OAK' for Oakland and 'BOS' for Boston) are correctly defined in your `AIRPORT` table based on your database schema. Adjust them if necessary based on the actual values in the database.

Question: show me city served both by NX and CP
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cities served by both the airlines with codes 'NX' and 'CP', you can use the following SQL query. This query will involve joining the `FLIGHT` table to relate airlines to flights and then to the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to fetch the cities where these flights stop.

Here is the SQL code:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT C.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN CITY C ON FS.STOP_AIRPORT = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE A.AIRLINE_CODE IN ('NX', 'CP')
GROUP BY C.CITY_NAME
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT A.AIRLINE_CODE) = 2;
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects distinct city names from the `CITY` table.
2. It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to get details about the cities served on those flights.
3. It also joins the `AIRLINE` table to filter the flights by the specified airline codes 'NX' and 'CP'.
4. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only cities served by both airlines are included in the results by counting distinct airline codes associated with each city and ensuring that the count is equal to 2 (indicating both airlines have flights to that city).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT C.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE

Question: how many airlines have flights with service class YN
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ) FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = "YN" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out how many airlines have flights with a service class of 'YN', we need to join the relevant tables that contain information about airlines, flights, and class of service. The `FLIGHT` table will give us details about flights, while the `FARE_BASIS` and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` tables will help us filter flights based on the service class.

Here is a possible SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_CODE) AS airline_count
FROM AIRLINE a
JOIN FARE f ON a.AIRLINE_CODE = f.FARE_AIRLINE
JOIN FARE_BASIS fb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN CLASS_OF_SERVICE c ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = c.BOOKING_CLASS
JOIN FLIGHT fl ON f.FARE_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE c.BOOKING_CLASS = 'YN';
```

### Explanation:
- We start by selecting a distinct count of airline codes.
- We join the `AIRLINE` table (a) with the `FARE` table (f) using the airline code.
- We then join the `FARE` table with the `FARE_BASIS` table (fb) based on the fare basis code.
- Next, we join `FARE_BASIS` with `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` (c) to filter the records by booking class.
- Finally, we join the `FARE` table with the `FLIGHT` table (fl) based on the fare ID.
- We filter the results by the condition that the booking class must be `'YN'`.

This query will return the number of distinct airlines that have flights using the service class 'YN'.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_CODE) AS airline_count

JOIN CLASS_OF_SERVICE c ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = c.BOOKING_CLASS
JOIN FLIGHT fl ON f.FARE_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE c.BOOKING_CLASS = 'YN';

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights available that leave from Oakland, California (OAK) on a Tuesday and arrive in Philadelphia (PHL) on a Wednesday, you'll need to join several tables based on the columns that connect them. Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    DAY.DATE_DAY,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DAY ON DAY.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday' OR DAY.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' 
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Oakland' AND 
    A1.STATE_CODE = 'CA' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Philadelphia' AND 
    A2.STATE_CODE = 'PA' AND 
    DAY.YEAR = YEAR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) AND 
    DAY.MONTH_NUMBER = MONTH(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) AND 
    DAY.DAY_NUMBER = DAY(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) 
    AND DAY.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday' 
    AND DATEADD(day, 1, F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = F.ARRIVAL_TIME
ORDER BY
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:

- The query selects columns that provide flight details, including the flight number, arrival and departure times, airline, and airport names.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Oakland) and once for the arrival airport (Philadelphia).
- The `DATE_DAY` table is used to filter for flights on Tuesday. The condition checks that if a flight departs on a Tuesday, it arrives the next day, which would be Wednesday.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that the departure must be from Oakland, California (OAK), and the destination must be Philadelphia (PHL).
- Finally, the results are ordered by the departure time for better readability.

Make sure to adapt times and conditions based on your actual data structure and requirements.

Question: of all airlines which airline has the most arrivals in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE GROUP BY FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the airline with the most arrivals in Atlanta, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that you want to group by the airline and count the flights that have Atlanta as the arrival airport. It also assumes the airport code for Atlanta is known (for example, ATL for Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport).

Here's a sample SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME, 
    COUNT(*) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'  -- Assuming 'ATL' is the airport code for Atlanta
GROUP BY 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME
ORDER BY 
    ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;  -- This will return only the airline with the most arrivals
```

### Explanation:
- We select the `AIRLINE_CODE` and `AIRLINE_NAME` from the `FLIGHT` and `AIRLINE` tables.
- We count the number of flights (arrivals) to Atlanta (`'ATL'`).
- We group the results by `AIRLINE_CODE` and `AIRLINE_NAME` to get the count for each airline.
- Finally, we order the results in descending order by `ARRIVAL_COUNT` and limit the results to 1 to get the airline with the most arrivals. 

Make sure to replace `'ATL'` with the correct airport code if it differs in your database.

Question: which airline has the most arrivals in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) , FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE GROUP BY FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine which airline has the most arrivals in Atlanta, you would first need to identify the airport code for Atlanta. Typically, Atlanta's airport code is ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport). You would then query the `FLIGHT` table to count the number of flights arriving at ATL and group the results by the airline.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    COUNT(*) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
GROUP BY 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE
ORDER BY 
    ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We are selecting the airline code and counting the number of arrivals (`COUNT(*)`).
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: This specifies the `FLIGHT` table with an alias `f` for convenience.
- **WHERE f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'**: This condition filters the results to only include flights arriving at Atlanta (airport code 'ATL').
- **GROUP BY f.AIRLINE_CODE**: This groups the results by airline, so we can count the number of arrivals for each one.
- **ORDER BY ARRIVAL_COUNT DESC**: This orders the resulting counts in descending order, so the airline with the most arrivals is at the top.
- **LIMIT 1**: This limits the result to just the top airline with the most arrivals. 

Make sure you adjust the airport code if "ATL" is different in your database or if there's a specific code for Atlanta in your dataset.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    COUNT(*) AS ARRIVAL_COUNT
FROM

Question: does UNITED airlines fly from BOSTON to DALLAS FORT WORTH
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To check whether UNITED Airlines has flights from Boston (BOS) to Dallas Fort Worth (DFW), you would need to write a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to confirm the existence of such flights in the database. The relevant tables include `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, and potentially `AIRPORT` to get the airport codes.

Here’s an SQL query that checks for flights from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth operated by UNITED Airlines:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER 
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE a.AIRLINE_NAME = 'UNITED'
  AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DFW';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting `FLIGHT_NUMBER` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table using the `AIRLINE_CODE`.
- We filter for flights where the `AIRLINE_NAME` is 'UNITED'.
- We also specify the departure airport as 'BOS' (Boston) and the arrival airport as 'DFW' (Dallas Fort Worth).
- Using `DISTINCT` ensures that we only get unique flight numbers in case there are multiple flights.

If this query returns any results, that would indicate there are flights from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth operated by UNITED Airlines. If it returns no results, then there are no such flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves flights from Philadelphia to Dallas and then from Dallas to San Francisco on Monday, July 8th, we need to utilize several tables from the database schema. Specifically, we will look at the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `DATE_DAY` tables. 

Here's a sample SQL query that outlines the required logic. Please adjust the specific field selections as needed:

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify the airports for Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco
WITH Airport_Codes AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE WHEN CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' THEN AIRPORT_CODE END AS PHILADELPHIA_AIRPORT,
        CASE WHEN CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' THEN AIRPORT_CODE END AS DALLAS_AIRPORT,
        CASE WHEN CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' THEN AIRPORT_CODE END AS SAN_FRANCISCO_AIRPORT
    FROM 
        CITY
    WHERE 
        CITY_NAME IN ('PHILADELPHIA', 'DALLAS', 'SAN FRANCISCO')
),
-- Step 2: Determine the specific date (Monday, July 8)
Selected_Date AS (
    SELECT YEAR, MONTH_NUMBER, DAY_NUMBER
    FROM DATE_DAY
    WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Monday' AND MONTH_NUMBER = 7 AND DAY_NUMBER = 8
)
-- Step 3: Retrieve flights
SELECT 
    F1.FLIGHT_ID AS PHILADELPHIA_TO_DALLAS_FLIGHT,
    F1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS PHILADELPHIA_TO_DALLAS_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_FROM_PHILADELPHIA,
    F1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ARRIVAL_IN_DALLAS,
    F2.FLIGHT_ID AS DALLAS_TO_SAN_FRANCISCO_FLIGHT,
    F2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS DALLAS_TO_SAN_FRANCISCO_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_FROM_DALLAS,
    F2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ARRIVAL_IN_SAN_FRANCISCO
FROM 
    FLIGHT F1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F2 ON F1.ARRIVAL_TIME < F2.DEPARTURE_TIME -- Ensuring there's a connection
JOIN 
    Airport_Codes AC ON F1.FROM_AIRPORT = AC.PHILADELPHIA_AIRPORT AND F1.TO_AIRPORT = AC.DALLAS_AIRPORT 
                      AND F2.FROM_AIRPORT = AC.DALLAS_AIRPORT AND F2.TO_AIRPORT = AC.SAN_FRANCISCO_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    Selected_Date SD ON F1.FLIGHT_DAYS = CONCAT(SD.YEAR, '-', SD.MONTH_NUMBER, '-', SD.DAY_NUMBER)
                   AND F2.FLIGHT_DAYS = CONCAT(SD.YEAR, '-', SD.MONTH_NUMBER, '-', SD.DAY_NUMBER)
WHERE 
    F1.CONNECTIONS = 0  -- Direct flight from Philadelphia to Dallas
    AND F2.CONNECTIONS = 0 -- Direct flight from Dallas to San Francisco
ORDER BY 
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME, F2.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Airport Codes CTE**: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find the airport codes for Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco.
2. **Selected Date CTE**: We create another CTE to filter for flights on the specific date (Monday, July 8).
3. **Flight Selection**: The main query selects flights from Philadelphia to Dallas and then connects to flights from Dallas to San Francisco. It ensures the first flight arrives in Dallas before the second flight departs with a simple JOIN condition. 

Note that the actual implementation may require additional handling for time zones, flight restrictions, and fare details, depending on your needs. This query is a simplified version focused on flight connections. Be sure to test and adapt as necessary according to the data and specific requirements in your context.

Question: i'd like a flight tomorrow from COLUMBUS to HOUSTON with a stopover in NASHVILLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias2 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_STOP AS FLIGHT_STOPalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHT_STOPalias0.STOP_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOPalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "COLUMBUS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve details of a flight from Columbus to Houston with a stopover in Nashville for tomorrow, you need to use a SQL query that involves multiple tables to get the required flight details. You would generally join the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially other relevant tables to complete this task.

Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Identify the current date and calculate 'tomorrow's' date.
WITH Tomorrow AS (
    SELECT DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS TOMORROW_DATE
)

SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_DAYS,
    fs.ARRIVAL_TIME AS STOP_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.DEPARTURE_TIME AS STOP_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a3 ON fs.STOP_AIRPORT = a3.AIRPORT_CODE,
    Tomorrow t
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'COLUMBUS')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'HOUSTON')
    AND a3.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'NASHVILLE')
    AND DATE(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = t.TOMORROW_DATE
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Date Calculation**: A Common Table Expression (CTE) is used to get tomorrow's date.
2. **Tables Joined**: The main `FLIGHT` table is joined with `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `AIRPORT` for all three locations: starting, ending, and stopover cities.
3. **City Filtering**: The codes for `COLUMBUS`, `HOUSTON`, and `NASHVILLE` are fetched based on the city names and matched with the respective airport codes.
4. **Departure Time Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters flights departing on tomorrow's date.
5. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the departure time of the flights.

This query will give you a list of flights that meet your criteria. Make sure to adapt any database-specific syntax or date functions as necessary for your specific SQL database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Cleveland to San Diego with a stop in Indianapolis tomorrow, you would typically need to join several tables in the database schema provided. Below is an SQL query that outlines how you might accomplish this:

```sql

JOIN
    flights_to_san_diego fts ON fti.FLIGHT_ID = fts.FLIGHT_ID
ORDER BY
    fti.FROM_CLE_DEPARTURE;
```

### Elements of the Query:
1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: The query uses CTEs `tomorrow`, `flights_to_indy`, and `flights_to_san_diego` to structure the logic and simplify the main query.
2. **Flight Selections**: It first selects flights from Cleveland to Indianapolis and then selects flights from Indianapolis to San Diego.
3. **Filtering by Date**: The `DATE(f.DEPARTURE_TIME)` condition is applied to filter flights based on the date of travel.
4. **Joins**: The final select combines the two sets of results to show the flights that you can take on the specified route.

### Notes:
- Ensure to replace `'YYYY-MM-DD'` with the actual date for tomorrow.
- The airport locations might need to be cross-verified with actual airport codes. 
- This SQL assumes all times and dates are properly formatted according to the SQL dialect used (the above is ANSI SQL compliant; it may vary slightly depending on the DBMS).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight that leaves on a Friday from Philadelphia (PHL) to Dallas (DFW) that makes a stop in Atlanta (ATL), you need to join multiple tables, including `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `CITY`, and any necessary tables for filtering by days and airport codes.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    FS.STOP_AIRPORT,
    FS.ARRIVAL_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FS.DEPARTURE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = C1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = C2.CITY_CODE 
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' 
    AND FS.STOP_AIRPORT = 'ATLANTA'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT` clause specifies the fields to retrieve, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and stop airport details.
- `FROM` clause starts with the `FLIGHT` table to get flights.
- Joins:
  - `FLIGHT_STOP` is joined to relate flights with their stops.
  - `CITY` is joined twice to identify the departure and arrival cities; once for Philadelphia (`C1`) and once for Dallas (`C2`).
  - The `DAYS` table is joined to check for the flight day.
- `WHERE` clause filters:
  - Ensures the departure city is Philadelphia.
  - Ensures the arrival city is Dallas.
  - Ensures a stop in Atlanta.
  - Ensures the flight is on a Friday.

Make sure the `CITY` and `DAYS` tables contain the proper `CITY_CODE` for Philadelphia, Dallas, and Atlanta, as well as the correct `DAYS_CODE` for Friday. You may need to adjust the query depending on actual field types or database structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query for booking a flight from Tampa to Seattle with a stop in Milwaukee on May 26, you'll need to retrieve relevant details from the flight, airport, and possibly fare tables depending on your criteria such as available stops and costs.

Assuming you want to find the available flights, here's an example SQL query (please adjust it based on your actual database contents and naming conventions):

```sql
-- Set the date for departure
SET @departure_date = '2023-05-26';  -- Adjust the year based on your flight date

-- Find flights that meet the criteria
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT AS From_Airport,
    f.TO_AIRPORT AS To_Airport,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT AS Stop_Airport,
    fs.STOP_NUMBER AS Stop_Number,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'TAMPA'  -- Replace with actual airport code for Tampa
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'MILWAUKEE'  -- Replace with actual airport code for Milwaukee
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEATTLE'  -- Replace with actual airport code for Seattle
    AND DATE(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = @departure_date
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects essential flight information including flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and the sequence of the stops.
2. It connects the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `FARE` tables to get all relevant data.
3. The WHERE clause filters results for departures from Tampa, stops in Milwaukee, and final destinations to Seattle on the specified date.
4. `$` represents a parameter for the date that you can set depending on your database management system.
5. Replace the airport names (TAMPA, MILWAUKEE, SEATTLE) with their respective airport codes from your `AIRPORT` table if you use codes instead of city names.
   
After finding available flights, you can follow up with additional queries to book, finalize payments, etc., depending on your requirements and database structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To get a list of round trip flights between Indianapolis and Orlando, you need to join several tables to retrieve the necessary data. Here's an SQL query to find round trip flights on December 27th and December 28th. The query assumes that `INDIANAPOLIS` and `ORLANDO` correspond to airport codes which we need to look up.

First, you should ensure that you have the airport codes for Indianapolis and Orlando. Assuming `INDY` is the code for Indianapolis International Airport (IND) and `MCO` is the code for Orlando International Airport (MCO), you can adjust the codes if they differ in your database.

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = f2.FLIGHT_ID  -- Ensure this join is valid for round trips
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Indianapolis International Airport' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando International Airport'
    AND f1.DEPARTURE_TIME::DATE IN ('2023-12-27', '2023-12-28')
    AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME::DATE IN ('2023-12-27', '2023-12-28')
    AND f1.STOPS = 0  -- Non-stop flights (adjust if you need to include stops)
    AND f2.STOPS = 0; -- Non-stop return flights
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects outbound flights (`f1`) from Indianapolis to Orlando and the corresponding return flights (`f2`) from Orlando to Indianapolis.
- It filters flights for the specified departure and return dates (December 27th and 28th).
- It joins with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names for better readability.
- The `WHERE` clause checks for direct (non-stop) flights by ensuring `STOPS = 0`; you can remove this if you want to include flights with stops.
  
Make sure you adjust the airport names or airport codes in the query according to your database. The format of dates may also need adjustment based on your SQL dialect or database configuration.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the first flight from Boston to Atlanta and the last flight from Atlanta to Boston using the provided database schema, you'll need to query the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to identify the relevant airports. Here’s how you can do this:

### Step 1: Identify Airport Codes
We will first identify the airport codes for Boston and Atlanta from the `AIRPORT` table:

- Boston's airport code is typically "BOS".
- Atlanta's airport code is typically "ATL".

### Step 2: Query for First Flight from Boston to Atlanta
To find the first flight from Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL):

```sql
SELECT MIN(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS FIRST_FLIGHT_TIME, FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'
GROUP BY FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE
ORDER BY FIRST_FLIGHT_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Query for Last Flight from Atlanta to Boston
To find the last flight from Atlanta (ATL) to Boston (BOS):

```sql
SELECT MAX(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS LAST_FLIGHT_TIME, FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS'
GROUP BY FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE
ORDER BY LAST_FLIGHT_TIME DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Summary
- The first query retrieves the earliest departure time, flight number, and airline code for flights from Boston to Atlanta.
- The second query retrieves the latest departure time, flight number, and airline code for flights from Atlanta to Boston. 

Make sure to execute these queries against your database to get the desired flight information.

Question: what flights are there from CLEVELAND to MIAMI on US that arrive in MIAMI before 1600
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Cleveland to Miami that arrive in Miami before 16:00 (4:00 PM) on US airlines, we will need to join several tables in the database schema you've provided. Specifically, we will use the `FLIGHT` table to find flight details, the `AIRPORT` table to get the relevant airport codes for Cleveland and Miami, and ensure we filter correctly for arrival times.

Here is the SQL query to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' 
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME < '16:00:00'
    AND F.AIRLINE_CODE IN (SELECT AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE WHERE NOTE LIKE '%US%');
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT clause**: We select relevant flight and airport details that we want to display.
- **FROM and JOIN clauses**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to match the departure and arrival airports.
- **WHERE clause**:
  - Check that the departure location (from) is Cleveland and the arrival location (to) is Miami.
  - Ensure that the arrival time is before 16:00:00.
  - Filter the airlines to include only US airlines, which is inferred through the `NOTE` column in the `AIRLINE` table.

Make sure your database has the correct mappings of airport names to airport codes for the query to work properly. Adjust the city names or any other filtering conditions as needed based on actual data.

Question: what is the cost of LIMOUSINE service in PHILADELPHIA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of the LIMOUSINE service in Philadelphia, you would typically need to join relevant tables from the schema related to ground services and airport locations. In this case, we want to look at the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which contains details about the transport type (LIMOUSINE) and its fare.

Assuming "PHILADELPHIA" relates to a specific city code from the `CITY` table, you would need to query that table to find the appropriate `CITY_CODE` first, and then use that to get the corresponding ground service cost.

Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';
```

This SQL query does the following:
1. Joins the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table on the `CITY_CODE`.
2. Filters results where the `CITY_NAME` is 'PHILADELPHIA'.
3. Filters results for `TRANSPORT_TYPE` that matches 'LIMOUSINE'.
4. Selects the `GROUND_FARE` for that specific service.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA' AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';

Question: please list the prices for a RENTAL CAR in PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list the prices for rental cars in Pittsburgh, we would typically need a table that includes rental car information such as pricing, location, and vehicle types. However, based on the provided schema, it seems there isn't a specific table related to rental cars.

Assuming you have a table for rental cars (for example, `RENTAL_CAR`), containing columns such as `CITY_CODE`, `AIRPORT_CODE`, `CAR_TYPE`, `RENTAL_PRICE`, etc., the SQL query to retrieve the rental car prices in Pittsburgh would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT RC.CAR_TYPE, RC.RENTAL_PRICE
FROM RENTAL_CAR RC
JOIN CITY C ON RC.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Pittsburgh';
```

If you don't have such a table and need to find related information through other tables in the provided schema, please provide additional details on how rental car prices are recorded, or let me know if there's some other way to find this information.

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the rental car rates in Dallas, you would typically query a `RENTAL_CAR` table or something similar that isn't present in the schema you've provided. However, if we have to assume that rental car rates are part of some kind of transportation information, we could hypothesize that they might relate to the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which includes a `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE`.

Assuming we are looking for rental car services in Dallas, you can use the `CITY` table to find the relevant city code for Dallas and then join it with the `GROUND_SERVICE` table to retrieve the rates. Here's the SQL query that would perform this:

```sql
SELECT GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Dallas';
```

This query does the following:
1. Selects the transport type (which should include rental cars if available) and the ground fare from the GROUND_SERVICE table.
2. Joins that table with the CITY table using the CITY_CODE to filter for records where the CITY_NAME is 'Dallas'. 

Please ensure that the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` for rental cars is correctly set in your database or adjust the query for the actual rental car category if it's defined differently.

Question: how much would RENTAL CAR cost in ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of rental cars in Atlanta, you would typically query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table that likely contains information regarding different transport types, including rental cars, as well as their corresponding fares. 

Assuming the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` in the `GROUND_SERVICE` refers specifically to rental cars (or there's a specific entry defining it), the following SQL query can be used:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'ATLANTA');
```

This query does the following:
1. It selects the `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
2. It filters the results using a subquery to get the `CITY_CODE` for Atlanta from the `CITY` table. 

Make sure to double-check if 'ATLANTA' is indeed the exact name stored in the `CITY` table and adjust the query if there are any discrepancies with naming or if more filters are needed.

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve rental car rates in San Francisco, you would typically have a table that contains information about rental car services, such as their rates. However, based on the provided schema, there doesn't seem to be a table specifically for rental car services or rates.

Assuming you would typically gather this information from a `GROUND_SERVICE` or a similar table, where transportation options including rental cars might be listed, you could run a SQL query to find transportation types that correspond to rental cars for the city code associated with San Francisco.

Here’s an example SQL query to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN 
    CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    CITY.CITY_NAME = 'San Francisco';
```

Please be sure to verify if `GROUND_SERVICE` includes rates for rental cars, as the schema provided doesn't confirm the presence of rental car data explicitly. If there is a different or specific table for rental cars, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN 
    CITY ON GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    CITY.CITY_NAME = 'San Francisco';

Question: how expensive is the SAN FRANCISCO LIMOUSINE service
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how expensive the San Francisco limousine service, you would typically query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, filtering based on the city code corresponding to San Francisco. Assuming that the city code for San Francisco has already been established, the SQL query would look as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_FARE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE 
WHERE 
    CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'San Francisco');
```

In the above query:
- We retrieve the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We filter the results using a subquery that gets the `CITY_CODE` for San Francisco from the `CITY` table.

Make sure to substitute the appropriate value for `CITY_CODE` if you already know it. If you have details specific to the limousine service in terms of `TRANSPORT_TYPE`, you may want to include additional filtering on that column.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GROUND_FARE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE 
WHERE

Question: what price is a LIMOUSINE service in BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the price of a limousine service in Boston, you will need to join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to filter for Boston specifically. Here is an SQL query that will help you accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT gs.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table on the `CITY_CODE` field.
- We filter for the city name 'BOSTON' and ensure that the transport type is 'LIMOUSINE'. 

Make sure that the relevant transport type for limousine services is correctly represented in your database as the query assumes the transport type is stored as 'LIMOUSINE'.

Question: how much does it cost to RENTAL CAR in TACOMA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of renting a car in Tacoma from the provided database schema, we need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which contains information about the transport type and its associated ground fare.

However, the schema does not directly provide a rental car cost for a specific city. Assuming that the `CITY_CODE` for Tacoma is available in the `CITY` table, you would first find the `CITY_CODE` for Tacoma and then look for the ground service that corresponds to a rental car.

Here’s a SQL query to find out the rental car cost in Tacoma:

```sql
SELECT GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Tacoma' AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'Rental Car';
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table using the `CITY_CODE`.
- We filter for records where the city name is 'Tacoma'.
- We specifically look for the transport type that matches 'Rental Car', and finally, we select the `GROUND_FARE` that corresponds to that combination. 

Please ensure that 'Rental Car' is the correct value for the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` you are searching for. If you have another naming convention for car rentals, adjust it accordingly.

Question: what are the RENTAL CAR rates in DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
The database schema provided does not include a specific table for rental car rates directly. However, rental car information might be included in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which contains fields like `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE`. To get the rental car rates specifically for Dallas, you would need to filter by the city code corresponding to Dallas.

Assuming we have the city code for Dallas, the SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    G.GROUND_FARE
FROM
    GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN
    CITY C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE
    C.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation:
- The `GROUND_SERVICE` table is queried to get the transport type (which might include RENTAL CARS) and their respective rates (`GROUND_FARE`).
- We then join this with the `CITY` table to filter for records related to the city of Dallas. 
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that we are only interested in services offered in Dallas by filtering on `CITY_NAME`. 

### Note:
Make sure that the city code for Dallas is correctly categorized in the `CITY` table, and that the appropriate transport type used for rental cars is specified in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.

Question: show me a list of RENTAL CAR fares at BOSTON airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of rental car fares at Boston Airport, assuming you have information about rental car fares stored in the database (for instance, in a table called `RENTAL_CAR` that would typically include details like `AIRPORT_CODE`, `RENTAL_CAR_COMPANY`, and `FARE`), you would join this table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter results for Boston Airport.

However, since the schema you provided does not explicitly include a `RENTAL_CAR` table, I will provide an SQL query based on the typical structure. If you have such a table, please adjust the table and column names accordingly.

Here's a general SQL query to fetch rental car fares at Boston Airport:

```sql
SELECT 
    rc.RENTAL_CAR_COMPANY,
    rc.FARE
FROM 
    RENTAL_CAR rc
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON rc.AIRPORT_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Boston';
```

In this query:
- `RENTAL_CAR` is assumed to be a table that stores rental car information, which includes the airport code.
- The `JOIN` operation connects `RENTAL_CAR` records with `AIRPORT` records based on the airport code.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only show rental cars available at "Boston" Airport.

Again, if you have different or additional tables that contain this data, you may need to adjust the query accordingly. Please provide more details about the exact structure of the rental car information, if available.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

    rc.RENTAL_CAR_COMPANY,

Question: what are the costs of RENTAL CAR in DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the costs of rental cars in Dallas from your database schema, you'll want to check if the schema includes a table related to rental cars. However, based on the provided schema, there does not seem to be a specific table for rental car costs.

Assuming the rental car costs are included in the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, you would typically join this table with the `CITY` table to filter the results for Dallas. Here's an SQL query that might give you the costs of ground transportation services (e.g., rental cars) in Dallas:

```sql
SELECT 
    GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN 
    CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'Dallas';
```

In this query:
- `GROUND_SERVICE` contains the `GROUND_FARE`, which is assumed to represent rental car costs among other transport types.
- The `CITY` table is joined to get the relevant city name for filtering purposes.

Make sure to adjust the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` in the `WHERE` clause (if necessary) to specify that you want only rental car data (if this type is explicitly defined in your schema).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN 
    CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'Dallas';

Question: how much does the LIMOUSINE service cost within PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "LIMOUSINE" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of the limousine service within Pittsburgh from the provided database schema, you would need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, specifically filtering for the city code associated with Pittsburgh and the transport type associated with limousine service.

However, since the details about which `CITY_CODE` corresponds to Pittsburgh and the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` for limousine services are not specified in the schema or provided data, I will assume hypothetically that we would filter by the appropriate identifiers.

Here is a sample SQL query to retrieve the limousine service cost for Pittsburgh:

```sql
SELECT GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' 
  AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';
```

This query assumes that:
- The `CITY` table has an entry for Pittsburgh.
- The `GROUND_SERVICE` table contains an entry for limousine services identified by a suitable `TRANSPORT_TYPE`.

Make sure that the actual values for `CITY_CODE` and the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` for limousine services are correctly substituted if they differ from the assumptions.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' 
  AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'LIMOUSINE';

Question: can you list costs of DENVER RENTAL CAR
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the costs related to the "DENVER RENTAL CAR," you would typically need to consult a data table that is related to rental cars or ground services. The provided schema does contain tables relevant to airport services and ground services. However, there isn't a specific table for rental car costs. 

Assuming we want to check for any transportation available in Denver along with their ground fares, it would involve the `GROUND_SERVICE` table along with the city code for Denver. We can retrieve this information by joining the relevant tables.

Here is an example SQL query that lists costs for ground transport services (which could include rental cars) at airports in Denver:

```sql
SELECT 
    g.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    g.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE g
JOIN 
    CITY c ON g.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

This SQL query joins the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table on the `CITY_CODE` to filter for services within the city of Denver. It then selects the type of transportation and their respective ground fares. Please adjust the query based on any specific tables or fields that may represent "rental car" services if they exist in your system.

SELECT 
    g.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    g.GROUND_FARE

Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from Atlanta to Boston on Wednesday afternoons and Thursday mornings, you'll first need some relevant data points:

1. Identify the airport codes for Atlanta (ATL) and Boston (BOS).
2. Define what constitutes "afternoon" and "morning".
3. Join appropriate tables to filter flights based on departure time and the specified day.

Here's the SQL query that encompasses these points. Assume "afternoon" is defined as departures between 12:00 PM (noon) and 5:59 PM and "morning" as departures from 12:00 AM (midnight) to 11:59 AM. Depending on the database system, you might need to adjust the time format.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ATL' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BOS' AND 
    (
        (D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND 
         F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '12:00:00' AND 
         F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '18:00:00')
        OR
        (D.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday' AND 
         F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '00:00:00' AND 
         F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00')
    )
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- We select flight number, departure and arrival times, airline code, and the airport names for better readability.
- We're joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Atlanta) and once for the arrival airport (Boston).
- We also join the `DAYS` table to filter flights based on the day.
- The query looks for flights departing from ATL to BOS on Wednesday afternoons and Thursday mornings by using conditional logic within the WHERE clause.
- Finally, the results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` to make it easier to review the schedule.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Atlanta to Boston on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, we'll write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables and applies the necessary filters. Assuming that 'ATLANTA' corresponds to a specific airport code (for example, 'ATL') and 'BOSTON' corresponds to another specific airport code (for example, 'BOS'), here is how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT_DAYS.DAY_NAME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    DAYS FLIGHT_DAYS ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = FLIGHT_DAYS.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS' 
    AND ((FLIGHT_DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 17)  -- Afternoon: 12 PM - 5 PM
         OR (FLIGHT_DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday' AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12));  -- Morning: before 12 PM
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We are selecting flight-related information including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, the day of the week, and the from/to airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: We are querying from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains all the flight information.

3. **JOIN**: We're joining the `DAYS` table to get the day names related to flight days.

4. **WHERE Clause**: We filter the results based on:
   - Departure from Atlanta (using the airport code 'ATL').
   - Arrival in Boston (using the airport code 'BOS').
   - The flight days condition combining:
     - Wednesday (where departure time is in the afternoon, defined as between 12 PM and 5 PM).
     - Thursday (where departure is in the morning, defined as before 12 PM).

### Notes:
- Adjust the airport codes ('ATL' for Atlanta and 'BOS' for Boston) as necessary based on your actual data.
- The `HOUR()` function may need to be replaced with a suitable function depending on the SQL dialect you are using (e.g., `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME)` for PostgreSQL). Make sure to format the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field correctly based on your database schema.
- Ensure to manage time based on your local timezone if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Atlanta to Boston on Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon using the provided database schema, you'll need to join multiple tables to get the necessary information regarding flights, timings, and locations. 

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' AND
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND
    (
        (FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%' AND 
         EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 6 AND 11) -- Wednesday morning
        OR
        (FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%TH%' AND 
         EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 17) -- Thursday afternoon
    );
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHT` table is used to get flight details including departure and arrival information.
- `AIRLINE` table is joined to get the name of the airline associated with each flight.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights specifically from Atlanta (ATL) to Boston (BOS).
- The `FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%'` condition is used to check if the flight is available on Wednesday, and it checks for flights that depart in the morning hours (between 6 AM and 11 AM).
- Similarly, the `FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%TH%'` condition checks for Thursday afternoon flights (between 12 PM and 5 PM).

### Note:
- Actual column names and time extraction methods may vary slightly based on the SQL dialect in use (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), so please adjust accordingly if you face any syntax errors.

Question: what is the total seating capacity of all aircraft of AA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE , AIRCRAFTalias0.CAPACITY FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 , EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the total seating capacity of all aircraft owned by American Airlines (AA), you'll need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table, where you can sum the `CAPACITY` field based on the `AIRLINE_CODE` (which is 'AA'). Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT SUM(a.CAPACITY) AS Total_Seating_Capacity
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = a.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

This query does the following:
1. Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table using the `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE` from the `FLIGHT` table and `AIRCRAFT_CODE` from the `AIRCRAFT` table.
2. Filters the results where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'AA', corresponding to American Airlines.
3. Sums up the `CAPACITY` field of the aircraft to get the total seating capacity.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT SUM(a.CAPACITY) AS Total_Seating_Capacity
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = a.AIRCRAFT_CODE

Question: shortest flights from NASHVILLE to ST. PETERSBURG
SQL:

PETERSBURG" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the shortest flights from Nashville to St. Petersburg, you need to look for flights that connect these two airports. Typically, this involves querying the `FLIGHT` table, filtering by the relevant `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`, and sorting by `TIME_ELAPSED`, which likely represents the total duration of the flight.

Assuming we have the airport codes for Nashville and St. Petersburg (let's say NASHVILLE is "BNA" and ST. PETERSBURG is "PIE"), the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BNA' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PIE'
ORDER BY 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED ASC;
```

In this query:

- We select several columns from the `FLIGHT` table to get relevant flight details.
- We filter the results to include only those flights departing from Nashville (BNA) and arriving at St. Petersburg (PIE).
- We order the results by `TIME_ELAPSED` to get the shortest flight duration first. 

Make sure to replace 'BNA' and 'PIE' with the actual airport codes for Nashville and St. Petersburg if they are different.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the shortest trip between Boston and San Francisco, we need to determine the most efficient flight route from the originating airport in Boston to the destination airport in San Francisco. This typically involves looking at direct flights first. In the database schema provided, the relevant tables we would be interested in include `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `FLIGHT_STOP` if there are connecting flights.

Here is a SQL query that can help find the shortest trip based on the total travel time (considering the `TIME_ELAPSED`) for both direct and connecting flights:

```sql
WITH Boston_Airports AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BOSTON'
), 
San_Francisco_Airports AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
)

SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    Boston_Airports BA ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = BA.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    San_Francisco_Airports SF ON F.TO_AIRPORT = SF.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
ORDER BY 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED ASC
LIMIT 1; -- Get the shortest trip 
```

This SQL query will select all flights from Boston to San Francisco, then it will join the necessary tables to get the relevant airport names and flight details, ordering by `TIME_ELAPSED` to find the shortest trip. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures we only get the shortest trip based on the calculated travel time. Adjust the `WHERE` clause values as necessary to match the actual location names in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the shortest flight from Boston to Philadelphia using the provided database schema, you would need to identify the relevant tables and columns for flights, airports, and possibly the times of departure and arrival.

Assuming "BOSTON" corresponds to an airport code in the AIRPORT table and "PHILADELPHIA" also corresponds to an airport code, you would perform the following steps in your SQL query:

1. Join the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT table to filter only flights departing from Boston and arriving in Philadelphia.
2. Calculate the total flight duration using the ARRIVAL_TIME and DEPARTURE_TIME columns.
3. Order the results by the flight duration and limit the output to one result to get the shortest flight.

Here's an example SQL query based on the above steps:

### Note:
- In the query, you might need to adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` values to match the actual corresponding airport codes or names from the AIRPORT table.
- The `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` function is used to compute the duration between departure and arrival; ensure this function is supported by the SQL dialect you're using (the example given is for MySQL). You might need to modify it for other SQL databases.

Question: list the shortest flight from SAN JOSE to HOUSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TIME_ELAPSED = ( SELECT MIN( FLIGHTalias1.TIME_ELAPSED ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3 , CITY AS CITYalias2 , CITY AS CITYalias3 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND CITYalias3.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias3.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the shortest flight from San Jose to Houston, you can join several tables based on the provided database schema. The key tables to join would be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_STOP`. You will need to ensure to filter for flights where the departure airport is San Jose and the arrival airport is Houston. Then, you will order the results by the `TIME_ELAPSED` field to get the shortest flight.

Here is the SQL query that does that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    DATEDIFF(F.ARRIVAL_TIME, F.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS DURATION,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Jose'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Houston'
ORDER BY 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns, including flight ID, flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and time elapsed for the flight.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice — once to get the departure airport details and once for the arrival airport.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights departing from San Jose (the specified airport) and arriving in Houston.
- The results are sorted by `TIME_ELAPSED` to find the shortest flight.
- `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the shortest flight is returned.

Make sure the names of airports match those in your database schema and adjust the airport names in the query if necessary.

Question: how many flights has CO into and out of ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" ) OR ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the number of flights operated by the airline with the code "CO" (Continental Airlines) into and out of Atlanta, you can craft an SQL query that uses the `FLIGHT` table to filter for flights associated with Atlanta's airport code. First, you need to identify the airport code for Atlanta, which is typically "ATL". The following SQL query counts the flights going to and coming from Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'
  AND AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- `COUNT(*)` : This aggregates the results to give you the total number of rows that satisfy the conditions.
- `FROM FLIGHT` : We're querying the `FLIGHT` table to gather flight information.
- `WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'` : This condition filters for flights that either leave from ATL (Atlanta) or arrive at ATL.
- `AND AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO'` : This restricts the results to those flights operated by the airline with the code 'CO'.

### Note: 
Ensure that 'CO' is indeed the correct code for the airline you are querying. Depending on your dataset context, double-check for any possible changes in airline codes.

FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' OR TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'

Question: what is the aircraft type with the greatest seating capacity
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.CAPACITY = ( SELECT MAX( AIRCRAFTalias1.CAPACITY ) FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the aircraft type with the greatest seating capacity, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the aircraft type (which I assume refers to the `BASIC_TYPE` or could be altered to select another attribute if needed) from the `AIRCRAFT` table, ordering the rows by seating capacity in descending order and limiting the result to just one row.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT BASIC_TYPE, MAX(CAPACITY) AS MAX_CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
GROUP BY BASIC_TYPE
ORDER BY MAX_CAPACITY DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query groups the entries by `BASIC_TYPE` and then retrieves the maximum seating capacity for each type, ordering the results to find the type with the greatest capacity. 

If you only want the aircraft that has the maximum seating capacity directly, the query could be simplified as:

```sql
SELECT AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
ORDER BY CAPACITY DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This second approach returns the description and capacity of the specific aircraft that has the greatest seating capacity. Adjust the fields to your needs based on what you want to display.

```

### Notes:
1. **Flight Dates**: The `DEPARTURE_TIME` column is filtered to match the specific date. Please adjust the year if needed.
2. **Travel Direction**: The route is specified to go from ATL to PHL. You might want to consider flights back from PHL to ATL as well, or adjust the join accordingly if that info is in another record.
3. **Fare Filter**: The condition `FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures that only round-trip fares are considered.
4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `ROUND_TRIP_COST` to get the cheapest fare.
5. **Limit**: Only one record is fetched, which will provide you the cheapest option.

Make sure your database supports the syntactical nuances being shown here (like date casting with `::date`). Adjust the column names based on your actual database schema if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest fare for a round trip from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 27, you'll need to join several tables to get the relevant information, including flight information, fare details, and airport details. Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this task.

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.FARE_ONE_DIRECTION_COST + f.FARE_ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS CHEAPEST_ROUND_TRIP_FARE
FROM FARE f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT fl ON f.FARE_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE a1.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
  AND a2.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
  AND f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
  AND fl.FLIGHT_DAYS = (SELECT DAYS_CODE 
                         FROM DAYS 
                         WHERE DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY') -- Assuming Dec 27 is a Wednesday
  AND f.FARE_BASIS_CODE IN (SELECT FARE_BASIS_CODE
                             FROM FARE_BASIS 
                             WHERE BASIS_DAYS = '12 27');
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM/FROM Clauses**: The query starts with the `FARE` table to get the fares. It joins on `AIRPORT` to filter flights from Indianapolis to Orlando and filters on the `FLIGHT` table for the specific flight date.
  
2. **Filtering for Airports**: It crosses checks the city names to ensure the fare corresponds to the right airports.
  
3. **Round Trip Requirement**: It checks that the fare is for a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).

4. **Flight Days**: We include criteria based on flight days, using a subquery to find the corresponding `DAYS_CODE` for the desired travel day.

5. **Fare Basis**: The fare basis is filtered to match the specific date.

6. **MIN Function**: Finally, `MIN` is used to extract the cheapest round trip fare by summing the cost for the round trip.

### Notes:
- Ensure your date handling and day of the week match your database’s format. In this query, we assumed Wednesday for December 27 in a possible year where that date falls on a Wednesday.
- Adjust `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` and other conditions based on your database schema and values.
- Ensure that all tables are populated with the necessary data and the columns are correctly referenced.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest round trip fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 25, the SQL query needs to join several tables: the airports, the flights, and the fares. We will assume that the airport codes for Indianapolis and Orlando need to be identified first. Additionally, we will consider that flights may operate directly or with stops, and fares may have certain restrictions.

Here’s a SQL query that captures these requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS origin
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS destination ON destination.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MCO'  -- Assuming 'MCO' is Orlando's airport code
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS f ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = origin.AIRPORT_CODE 
                  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = destination.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON fare.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    origin.AIRPORT_CODE = 'IND'  -- Assuming 'IND' is Indianapolis' airport code
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME::DATE = '2023-12-25'  -- Use the appropriate date format
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'  -- Ensure it's a round trip fare
ORDER BY 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;  -- Get the cheapest fare
```

### Notes:
- Adjust the airport codes based on actual data. Commonly, 'IND' is the code for Indianapolis International Airport and 'MCO' for Orlando International Airport.
- Ensure the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field references the correct date being queried, particularly matching the year (here assumed as 2023).
- The condition `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` is included to filter only those fares that are for round trips.
- The `LIMIT 1` clause retrieves the cheapest round trip fare.
- Depending on the exact format of the datetime fields in your schema, you may need to format the `DEPARTURE_TIME` check appropriately.

To find the cheapest round trip fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 27, you would need to execute a SQL query that joins the relevant tables and filters the results based on the specified criteria. The following SQL query outlines the necessary steps to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    f.from_airport,
    f.to_airport,
    fare.round_trip_cost,
    fare.fare_basis_code,
    f.departure_time,
    f.arrival_time
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.flight_id = ff.flight_id
JOIN
    FARE fare ON ff.fare_id = fare.fare_id
WHERE
    f.from_airport = (SELECT airport_code FROM AIRPORT WHERE airport_name = 'INDIANAPOLIS')
    AND f.to_airport = (SELECT airport_code FROM AIRPORT WHERE airport_name = 'ORLANDO')
    AND fare.round_trip_required = 'Y'
    AND f.departure_time BETWEEN '2023-12-27 00:00:00' AND '2023-12-27 23:59:59'
ORDER BY
    fare.round_trip_cost ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the fields to retrieve, including flight ID, fare information, and times.
2. **FROM & JOIN**:
   - `FLIGHT`: Base table that holds flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE`: Joins the flight with its corresponding fares.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a Boeing 747 flight from Baltimore to San Francisco before 10:00 AM on a Tuesday, we need to query the `FLIGHT`, `AIRCRAFT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` tables. 

The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, a.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = a.AIRCRAFT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
  AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
  AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday'
  AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'
  AND a.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%747%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We are selecting the flight number, departure time, and aircraft description.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table on the `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Baltimore) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
- We join with the `DAYS` table to filter for flights on Tuesday.
- The condition checks that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before 10:00 AM and that the aircraft description contains '747'.

Make sure to adjust the names of the flights, airports, and other identifiers based on the actual data we have in the tables if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights in First Class on American Airlines (AA) from Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) to San Francisco (SFO), we need to join multiple tables to filter the results according to the specified criteria. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,

    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DFW'
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'
    AND cos.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'First Class';
```

### Explanation:
- **Selected Columns:** The query selects relevant flight details such as flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, stops, connections, origin, and destination, as well as fare details and the class description.
- **Joins:**
  - `FLIGHT f`: The main table with flight information.
  - `FARE_FARE ff`: Join to associate flights with their corresponding fares.
  - `FARE fare`: To retrieve fare details based on fare IDs.
  - `FARE_BASIS fb`: To get fare basis details to check for booking class.
  - `CLASS_OF_SERVICE cos`: To ensure we're filtering for the First Class booking.
- **Filters:**
  - `f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'`: Filters for American Airlines.
  - `f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DFW'`: Filters for flights departing from Dallas Fort Worth.
  - `f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'`: Filters for flights arriving at San Francisco (SFO).
  - `cos.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'First Class'`: Filters for First Class service.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the different classes of service and their associated prices for flights in the US, you need to join multiple tables from your schema. Specifically, you'll want to focus on the `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` tables. 

Here's a SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    cs.BOOKING_CLASS,
    cs.CLASS_DESCRIPTION,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE cs ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = cs.BOOKING_CLASS
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE OR f.TO_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a.COUNTRY_NAME = 'USA'
ORDER BY 
    cs.RANK;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the `BOOKING_CLASS`, `CLASS_DESCRIPTION`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, and `ROUND_TRIP_COST`.
- It joins the `FARE` table with the `FARE_BASIS` table to link fare details with their respective booking classes.
- It further joins the `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table to get the actual description of each class.
- To filter only the prices applicable to flights within the United States, it joins the `AIRPORT` table using the airport codes from the fare table, ensuring that either the departure or arrival airport is within the USA.
- The results are ordered by the rank of the service classes for better readability. 

Ensure that the relevant tables have data and that the relationships among them are correctly established in your database for the query to function optimally.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest flight from Boston to Dallas Fort Worth leaving at 08:00 AM, you would construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables, specifies the desired departure location and time, and selects the earliest flight based on the departure time. Assuming "BOSTON" corresponds to a city code that relates to "FROM_AIRPORT" and "DALLAS FORT WORTH" corresponds to a city code for "TO_AIRPORT", the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON')
    AND A_TO.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS FORT WORTH')
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '08:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selection**: The query selects the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time.
2. **Joins**: 
   - It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table for both departure (BOSTON) and arrival (DALLAS FORT WORTH) airports.
3. **Filters**:
   - It filters by city names to get the respective `CITY_CODE`.
   - It also ensures the departure time is greater than or equal to 08:00:00.
4. **Sorting and Limiting**: The results are ordered by departure time in ascending order, and `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the earliest flight is returned.

Make sure to adjust the `CITY_CODE` lookup according to how your data is structured if the city names are not the exact ones used in the database.

Question: show me the DAILY flight schedule between BOSTON and PITTSBURGH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME , FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 , FLIGHT_LEG AS FLIGHT_LEGalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_LEGalias0.LEG_FLIGHT AND FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" AND FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_LEGalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the daily flight schedule between Boston and Pittsburgh, you will need to use SQL to join various tables relevant to flights, including those that hold airport, city, and flight information. Below is an example SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Clause**: The query selects relevant fields, including flight numbers, airline codes, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
   
2. **From Clause**: It starts from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains the core information about flights.
   
3. **Joins**:
   - It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for flights departing from Boston and once for flights arriving in Pittsburgh).
   - It further joins the `CITY` table twice to fetch the city names based on the airport codes.

4. **Where Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights from Boston to Pittsburgh.

5. **Order By Clause**: It orders the schedule by the departure time for easier readability.

Make sure all the table names and field names align with your actual database schema. Adjust any names if necessary depending on the actual data in your tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first flight into Houston from Dallas on March 1 and the last flight from Houston to Dallas on the same day, you can utilize the `FLIGHT` table to filter flights based on the specified criteria. The query may become a bit complex since you want both the first and last flight for specified cities and a specific date. 

Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Getting the first flight from DALLAS to HOUSTON on 3/1
WITH FirstFlight AS (
    SELECT 
        FLIGHT_ID, 
        AIRLINE_CODE, 
        AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
        DEPARTURE_TIME, 
        ARRIVAL_TIME, 
        FROM_AIRPORT, 
        TO_AIRPORT,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY DEPARTURE_TIME) AS FlightRank
    FROM FLIGHT
    WHERE 
        FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS')
        AND TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON')
        AND CAST(DEPARTURE_TIME AS DATE) = '2023-03-01'
),

-- Getting the last flight from HOUSTON to DALLAS on 3/1
LastFlight AS (
    SELECT 
        FLIGHT_ID, 
        AIRLINE_CODE, 
        AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
        DEPARTURE_TIME, 
        ARRIVAL_TIME, 
        FROM_AIRPORT, 
        TO_AIRPORT,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY DEPARTURE_TIME DESC) AS FlightRank
    FROM FLIGHT
    WHERE 
        FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON')
        AND TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS')
        AND CAST(DEPARTURE_TIME AS DATE) = '2023-03-01'
)

-- Selecting the results
SELECT * FROM FirstFlight WHERE FlightRank = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM LastFlight WHERE FlightRank = 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT_ID, AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE_FLIGHT, DEPARTURE_TIME, ARRIVAL_TIME, FROM_AIRPORT, TO_AIRPORT**: Selected relevant flight details.
- **ROW_NUMBER()**: This function is used to rank the flights based on their departure time, both for the first flight from Dallas to Houston and the last flight from Houston to Dallas.
- **CAST(DEPARTURE_TIME AS DATE) = '2023-03-01'**: Filters flights to only those on March 1, 2023.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines the results of the two queries.

You just need to replace 'DALLAS' and 'HOUSTON' with the actual names used in your `AIRPORT` database, if they differ. 

Make sure the formatting and data types match what your database structure expects, especially for date comparisons.

Question: show me the most expensive fare
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FARE AS FAREalias0 WHERE FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST = ( SELECT MAX( FAREalias1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ) FROM FARE AS FAREalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias1.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the most expensive fare from the database, you would need to query the `FARE` table and select the maximum value from either the `ONE_DIRECTION_COST` or `ROUND_TRIP_COST` columns. Here's a possible SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FARE
WHERE ONE_DIRECTION_COST = (
    SELECT MAX(ONE_DIRECTION_COST)
    FROM FARE
) 
OR ROUND_TRIP_COST = (
    SELECT MAX(ROUND_TRIP_COST)
    FROM FARE
)
LIMIT 1;  -- Optionally limit to one record in case of ties
```

This query will retrieve all columns from the `FARE` table for the row(s) with the highest one-way cost or round-trip cost. If there are multiple fares that are tied for the highest value, the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only one of them is returned.

Question: show me the flights from DENVER to BALTIMORE or WASHINGTON that arrive before or around noon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias2 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" ) OR ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias2.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < arrival_time0 ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver to either Baltimore or Washington that arrive before or around noon, you can write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables based on your schema. Assuming that Denver's airport code is "DEN", Baltimore's airport code is "BWI", and Washington's airport code is "DCA", here's how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' 
    AND (F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI' OR F.TO_AIRPORT = 'DCA')
    AND TIME(ARRIVAL_TIME) <= '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT` is used to specify the columns you want to retrieve from the results, including flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, from airport, and to airport.
- `FROM FLIGHT F` specifies that you are querying the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results:
  - `F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'` ensures the flight departs from Denver.
  - `(F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI' OR F.TO_AIRPORT = 'DCA')` checks that the destination is either Baltimore or Washington.
  - `TIME(ARRIVAL_TIME) <= '12:00:00'` ensures that the flight arrives at or before noon.

Make sure to replace 'DEN', 'BWI', and 'DCA' with the actual airport codes if they differ in your database. Adjust the time format as required by your SQL dialect.

    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,

Question: show me the flights from IAD to SAN FRANCISCO leaving after 1800
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "IAD" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) that depart after 18:00 (6 PM), we can use a SQL query that filters the flights based on the departure time. Assuming the `ARRIVAL_TIME` and `DEPARTURE_TIME` fields are stored in a format that allows time comparisons, you can write the SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IAD' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO' 
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:

- **SELECT Clause**: This clause specifies the columns we want to display in the result. In this case, we are interested in the airline code, flight number, departure time, arrival time, number of stops, and time elapsed.
  
- **FROM Clause**: This indicates that we are querying data from the `FLIGHT` table.

- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - `FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IAD'` ensures that we are only getting flights that depart from IAD.
  - `FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO'` ensures that we are only listing flights that arrive at San Francisco International Airport.
  - `FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00'` filters the results to only include flights that depart after 6 PM.

Make sure to verify the format of `DEPARTURE_TIME` in your database to ensure that the comparison is valid. If the format of `DEPARTURE_TIME` includes date information along with time, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all overnight flights from Washington to San Francisco along with their fares, you need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you'll need to access the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, and potentially other related tables. Below is an SQL query that demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND A2.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' 
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > F.ARRIVAL_TIME;  -- This condition is adjusted for overnight flights
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns:** We select columns to display the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the costs of the fares.
2. **Join Tables:**
   - **FLIGHT** to obtain flight details.
   - **AIRPORT** twice: once for the departure airport (Washington) and once for the arrival airport (San Francisco).
   - **FLIGHT_FARE** and **FARE** to get the fare information for the selected flights.
3. **Where Clause:**
   - We filter for flights departing from Washington and arriving in San Francisco. The exact city names may vary depending on how your database stores these values (ensure they match).
   - The condition `F.DEPARTURE_TIME > F.ARRIVAL_TIME` is a placeholder that should be adjusted depending on how your database tracks overnight flights. You may need to calculate the duration of the flight or check if the arrival time is the next day (for example, if the departure time is late evening, and you expect the arrival the next morning).
  
Make sure to adjust column names and conditions based on the exact structure of your database and the specific requirements for identifying "overnight" flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To find an early morning flight from Dallas (DAL) to Houston (HOU) on February 22, returning late in the evening of the same day, you would need to query the relevant tables in your schema, specifically the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly other tables to filter the necessary criteria. 

Since you only provided the city names and not the specific airport codes, I'll assume `DALLAS` corresponds to DFW or DAL and `HOUSTON` corresponds to IAH or HOU. You may need to replace the airport codes used in the query with the correct codes from your database.

Here's a possible SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Assuming airport codes are DFW for Dallas and IAH for Houston
WITH Flights AS (
    SELECT
        FLIGHT_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        F.FLIGHT_ID,
        F.FROM_AIRPORT,
        F.TO_AIRPORT,
        F.AIRLINE_CODE
    FROM
        FLIGHT F
    WHERE
        F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DFW' -- Change if your airport code is different
        AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'IAH' -- Change if your airport code is different
        AND DATE_DAY.MONTH_NUMBER = 2
        AND DATE_DAY.DAY_NUMBER = 22
)

-- Early morning outbound flight query
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    Flights 
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 5 AND 9 -- Filtering for early morning flights
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME::DATE = '2023-02-22';

-- Late evening return flight query
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    Flights 
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 18 -- Assuming late evening starts at 6 PM
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME::DATE = '2023-02-22';
```

### Explanation:
1. The `WITH Flights AS` clause defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) that selects flights from Dallas to Houston on the specified date (February 22).
2. The first SELECT query filters for early morning flights, checking if the departure time falls between 5 AM and 9 AM.
3. The second SELECT query looks for late evening return flights, filtering for departure times starting from 6 PM onward.

### Notes:
- Replace the airport codes to match the actual codes used in your database.
- Assume that the datetime is in a proper format and ensure your SQL server supports extracting hours in this manner (the specific syntax may vary).
- Make sure that the table that holds `DATE_DAY` information is joined or filtered appropriately to reflect the context of the actual day (ensuring `DATE_DAY.MONTH_NUMBER` and `DATE_DAY.DAY_NUMBER` match). This query assumes those filtering conditions come from a context that defines the specific day.

Question: what flights leave SAN FRANCISCO after 2000 and go to DALLAS FORT WORTH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias2 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "FORT WORTH" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that leave from San Francisco (SFO) to Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) after the year 2000, you would typically execute a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to filter the flights based on the departure airport, arrival airport, and the flight departure time. 

Assuming you need to filter based on a specific column in the `FLIGHT` table that represents the departure time, and based on the schema you've provided, here is how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, f.ARRIVAL_TIME, f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
  AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS FORT WORTH'
  AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME > '2000-01-01';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We want to get the flight number, departure time, arrival time, and airline code.
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: We're querying the `FLIGHT` table and aliasing it as `f`.
- **JOIN AIRPORT**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (San Francisco) and once for the destination airport (Dallas Fort Worth).
- **WHERE**: We filter:
  - The departure airport should be San Francisco: `a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'`.
  - The arrival airport should be Dallas Fort Worth: `a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS FORT WORTH'`.
  - The departure time must be after January 1, 2000, assuming a datetime format for `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

Make sure to adjust the airport names in the WHERE clause to match exactly how they are stored in your `AIRPORT` table.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, f.ARRIVAL_TIME, f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: is the AA flight 813 from BOSTON to OAKLAND a nonstop flight
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if the AA flight 813 from Boston to Oakland is a nonstop flight, you will need to check the `FLIGHT` table for the specified flight and then examine the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to see if any stops are recorded for that flight. A nonstop flight will not have any entries in the `FLIGHT_STOP` table for that flight.

Here is an SQL query that can be used to check if the flight is nonstop:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    COUNT(fs.STOP_NUMBER) AS STOP_COUNT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
LEFT JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '813'
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND')
GROUP BY 
    f.FLIGHT_ID;
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the `FLIGHT_ID` from the `FLIGHT` table along with the count of `STOP_NUMBER` from the `FLIGHT_STOP` table.
- We're checking for the specific airline (`AA`), flight number (`813`), and ensuring that the departure and arrival airports match BOSTON and OAKLAND.
- We use a LEFT JOIN on `FLIGHT_STOP` to get all records from the `FLIGHT` table and any matching records from `FLIGHT_STOP`. If there are no stops, `STOP_COUNT` will be 0 for that flight.
- The `GROUP BY` clause helps us aggregate the results based on the flight.

### Result Interpretation:
- If `STOP_COUNT` equals 0, then the flight is a nonstop flight. If it's greater than 0, then it has stops.

    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    COUNT(fs.STOP_NUMBER) AS STOP_COUNT

Question: is the AA flight 813 from BOSTON to OAKLAND a flight that goes straight through from BOSTON to OAKLAND without stopping at another city
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if flight AA 813 from Boston to Oakland is a direct flight (i.e., does not stop at another city), you can query the `FLIGHT` table along with the `FLIGHT_STOP` table. You want to check if there are any stops associated with this flight, which would indicate that it does not go straight through.

Here is the SQL query that could be used to find this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    f.TO_AIRPORT, 
    COUNT(fs.STOP_NUMBER) AS NUM_STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
LEFT JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = '813' 
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON') 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND')
GROUP BY 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.FROM_AIRPORT, f.TO_AIRPORT;
```

In this query:

- We perform a LEFT JOIN between `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` on the `FLIGHT_ID`.
- We filter for the specific airline (AA) and flight number (813), and specify the departure (Boston) and arrival (Oakland) airports.
- We count the number of stops by counting the `STOP_NUMBER`.
- If `NUM_STOPS` is 0, it indicates that the flight goes straight through from Boston to Oakland.

To interpret the result:

- If `NUM_STOPS` equals 0, then AA flight 813 is a direct flight from Boston to Oakland.
- If `NUM_STOPS` is greater than 0, then it indicates there are stops along the way, and thus it is not a direct flight.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights on United Airlines (UA) and Northwest Airlines (NW) that go into Denver, as well as all flights on NW and UA that fly out of Denver, you can use the following SQL queries. 

Assuming the airport code for Denver is `DEN`, here are the SQL queries:

```sql
-- List all flights on UA and NW that go into Denver
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE (AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' OR AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW') AND TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN';

-- List all flights on UA and NW that fly out of Denver
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE (AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' OR AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW') AND FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN';
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Query:** This selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is either 'UA' or 'NW', and the destination airport (`TO_AIRPORT`) is 'DEN'.
  
2. **Second Query:** This selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is either 'UA' or 'NW', and the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) is 'DEN'. 

Make sure to replace 'DEN' with the appropriate airport code if it's different in your actual dataset.

Raw LLM Response:
To find nonstop flights between Boston and Dallas that leave between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM (1400 hours), you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes you have the appropriate mappings for Boston and Dallas to their respective airport codes (let's assume "BOS" for Boston and "DFW" for Dallas as common examples; please replace them with the actual airport codes if they differ).

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DFW' AND
    f.STOPS = 0 AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 14;
```

### Explanation:
- **Selection of columns**: The query selects relevant details about the flight, including the flight ID, airline code, flight number, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and airport codes.
- **Conditions**:
  - Filtering `FROM_AIRPORT` to Boston (BOS) and `TO_AIRPORT` to Dallas (DFW).
  - Ensuring there are no stops (`STOPS = 0`).
  - Checking the departure time falls between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM using the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour from the `DEPARTURE_TIME`. 

Please adjust the airport codes or any other specific field names as necessary based on your actual database schema.

Question: okay what i'd like to do on this one is go from WASHINGTON to ATLANTA i want a nonstop and i'd like to leave around 5pm
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= departure_time1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of nonstop flights from Washington to Atlanta, departing around 5 PM, you'll need to JOIN multiple tables based on the relevant keys and apply the necessary filters. Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON'
    )
AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ATLANTA'
    )
AND 
    f.STOPS = 0 -- This ensures the flight is nonstop
AND 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '18:00:00' -- Leaves around 5 PM
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Fields**: Selects fields such as the flight number, airline code, airline name, departure time, arrival time, and airport codes for better understanding.
  
2. **JOIN Statement**: Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names associated with each flight.

3. **WHERE Conditions**:
   - Filters the flights with the departure airport set to Washington and the arrival airport set to Atlanta using subqueries that retrieve airport codes based on the location.
   - Ensures that the flight is nonstop by checking that the number of stops is zero (`f.STOPS = 0`).
   - Filters the departure time to only include flights that leave between 5 PM and 6 PM.

4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the departure time for easier viewing.

### Note:
- Make sure that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` column in the `AIRPORT` table contains the expected values "WASHINGTON" and "ATLANTA" or adjust the text accordingly. Validate that you have the correct data format in your database for time comparisons too.

Question: show me all flights direct only from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO or OAKLAND that arrive before 1000 local time
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias2 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" ) OR ( FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME < arrival_time0 ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.CONNECTIONS = connections0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all direct flights from Boston to San Francisco or Oakland that arrive before 10:00 AM local time, you can construct the following SQL query. Assuming that the appropriate time zone information is correctly related and that you have a `TIME_ZONE` table that provides the time zone details for each city, you would need to take that into account.

Here's a SQL query based on your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND (a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' OR a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND')
    AND f.STOPS = 0  -- Assuming that STOPS = 0 indicates a direct flight
    AND TIME_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(f.ARRIVAL_TIME, INTERVAL - (SELECT HOURS_FROM_GMT FROM TIME_ZONE WHERE TIME_ZONE_CODE = a_to.TIME_ZONE_CODE) HOUR), '%H:%i') < '10:00'
ORDER BY 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **Tables Used**: The `FLIGHT` table is used to get flight details, while the `AIRPORT` table is used to get the airport names.
- **Conditions**:
  - Filter to flights from Boston.
  - Check that the destination is either San Francisco or Oakland.
  - Ensure that the flight is direct (assuming that a flight has zero stops).
  - Convert the `ARRIVAL_TIME` to the local time at the destination airport using the `HOURS_FROM_GMT` from the `TIME_ZONE` table and compare it to '10:00'.
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `ARRIVAL_TIME` to obtain a chronological listing.

Make sure that the actual database schema includes the implementation of `TIME_FORMAT`, `DATE_ADD`, or any equivalent functions to handle the time conversion, as the syntax may vary depending on the SQL dialect (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Adjust as necessary!

Question: what is the cost of the AIR TAXI OPERATION at PHL airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "PHL" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "AIR TAXI OPERATION" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the cost of the "AIR TAXI OPERATION" at PHL airport using the given database schema, we need to understand where the relevant information about costs and operations is stored. Given the schema, the tables that might contain relevant information regarding ground services or flight operations related to "AIR TAXI OPERATION" are likely:

1. **GROUND_SERVICE**: This might include details about various ground services available, including the type of service (like an air taxi) and their associated costs.
2. **AIRPORT**: This would provide the airport details but generally wouldn't directly provide cost information.

Assuming the `GROUND_SERVICE` table includes the type of operation (in this case, "AIR TAXI"), we can write a SQL query to find the associated cost for "AIR TAXI OPERATION" at the PHL airport.

Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT 
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHL' 
    AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'AIR TAXI OPERATION';
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- It uses a `JOIN` to connect the `GROUND_SERVICE` table to the `AIRPORT` table on the `AIRPORT_CODE` to ensure we are only looking at services provided at PHL.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for the airport code 'PHL' and the specific transport type 'AIR TAXI OPERATION'.

Make sure that the value 'AIR TAXI OPERATION' is correctly spelled and matches how it is recorded in the database. If it's stored differently, you will need to adjust that part of the query accordingly.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHL' 
    AND GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'AIR TAXI OPERATION';

Raw LLM Response:
To find the least expensive fare for a flight from Washington to Denver on April 20 at around 5 o'clock in the morning, you will need to join several tables in the database schema. You'll need to check the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables among others to get the desired information.

Here’s a possible SQL query that could perform this search:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
       FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FARE FARE ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
  AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER' 
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME::time BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '05:59:59'
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME::date = '2023-04-20' -- Assuming the year is 2023
ORDER BY FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the flight number, departure time, one-way cost, and round trip cost.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to link flight information with fare and location.
- It specifies the departure city as 'WASHINGTON' and the destination city as 'DENVER'.
- The departure time is filtered to be around 5 o'clock in the morning using the SQL time range.
- It also ensures that the date is April 20, 2023.
- Finally, it orders the results by the least expensive fare (one-way cost) and limits the output to the cheapest available option.

Make sure to adjust any specific column names based on your actual table definitions if they differ from the ones provided in the schema.

Question: show me all the night fares between PHILADELPHIA and SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all night fares between Philadelphia and San Francisco, you'll need to join several tables from your database schema, particularly the `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and any relevant city or airport tables to filter the specific origin and destination. 

Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID, 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    f.TO_AIRPORT, 
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    fb.BOOKING_CLASS, 
    fb.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHILADELPHIA'
    )
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT IN (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    )
    AND fb.NIGHT = 'Y';
```

- This SQL query selects fares (ID, from and to airports, costs) associated with fare basis types that indicate they are valid for night flights.
- The inner SELECT statements are used to find the airport codes for both Philadelphia and San Francisco based on their names.
- The condition `AND fb.NIGHT = 'Y'` filters for night fares, assuming that the `NIGHT` column in the `FARE_BASIS` table uses 'Y' to indicate night fares. Adjust this condition based on your actual schema definitions if they differ.

Question: hi i want a round trip ticket to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip ticket to Dallas, we would typically need to query several tables involving flights, fares, and possibly airlines or airports. Below is an example SQL query that could help you find round trip flights to and from Dallas, assuming we have the necessary details like departure airport and travel dates.

Here's a query structure you could use:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FLIGHT_ID -- Assuming return flights are also in FLIGHT table 
WHERE 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    AND fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE IS NOT NULL;  -- If you want to filter by certain fare restrictions
```

### Notes:
- This SQL query assumes you have some information about the departure location and possibly the date. You may need to add specific filters for departure airports, departure and return dates, etc.
- Adjust the `FROM` and `TO` conditions based on how you define "Dallas" (it could refer to multiple airports, e.g., DFW or DAL).
- The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` should be checked to ensure that the fare is for a round-trip.
- Depending on your database design, you may need to modify column names or join conditions.

Question: what is the COACH economy class night service from BOSTON to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find the COACH economy class night service from Boston to San Francisco, we will need to join several tables in the database schema provided. The key tables we will likely query are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY`.

Here is the SQL query that retrieves the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = ap_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = ap_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_from ON ap_from.CITY_CODE = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_to ON ap_to.CITY_CODE = c_to.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    AND c_to.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND fb.CLASS_TYPE = 'ECONOMY'
    AND fb.NIGHT = 'Y';  -- assuming 'Y' indicates it is a night service for economy class
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Table Joins**: The query uses JOINs to combine the relevant tables:
   - `FLIGHT` contains flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` link flights to their fare pricing.
   - `FARE_BASIS` contains the booking class and conditions such as night service.
   - `AIRPORT` and `CITY` link airports to their respective cities for filtering by city names.
  
2. **Filters**: The query filters for flights originating in Boston and arriving in San Francisco and selects only those fares categorized as COACH (economy) that also qualify as night flights.

3. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects relevant flight details such as the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, airports, and pricing.

### Note:
- Ensure that the values used in the WHERE clause (like `'Y'` for night service) are mapped correctly according to your data representation.
- The actual identifiers for economy class and night service (e.g., the exact value to indicate it's coach class) may vary based on your database's implementation. Adjust accordingly based on the actual data definitions.

Question: how many nonstop flights going from DALLAS to OAKLAND 7 27
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out how many nonstop flights are going from Dallas to Oakland on July 27, you would typically query the `FLIGHT` table, filtering for the departure airport code for Dallas and the arrival airport code for Oakland, as well as considering the date. 

Assuming you know the airport codes for Dallas and Oakland (let's say 'DFW' for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and 'OAK' for Oakland International Airport), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Nonstop_Flight_Count
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DFW'
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'OAK'
  AND FLIGHT_DAYS = '2023-07-27'
  AND STOPS = 0; -- Assuming STOPS = 0 indicates a nonstop flight
```

### Notes:
1. Replace 'DFW' and 'OAK' with the actual airport codes if they differ.
2. The date format in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column should match the format used in your database, and you may need to adjust it accordingly.
3. Ensure that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column type supports date values or is formatted correctly as a string. Adjust the date filter as needed based on the date storing technique in your schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight schedule from Baltimore to San Francisco on Friday nights, you can use the following SQL query. 

Note: This example assumes that the city codes for Baltimore and San Francisco are stored in the `CITY` table, and the `CITY_CODE` is used to correlate with the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables. The query fetches details relevant to the flights, specifically focusing on those departed on Friday nights.

First, make sure to look up the `CITY_CODE` for Baltimore and San Francisco if you do not know them. Replace the placeholders accordingly.

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOP.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS TO_CITY ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY'
    AND 
    (
        (CAST(SUBSTRING(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 1, 2) AS INT) >= 18) -- Departure after 6 PM (18 hours)
        OR (CAST(SUBSTRING(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 1, 2) AS INT) = 23) -- Flights leaving at 11 PM
    )
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specify the desired columns to be included in the results.
- **JOIN**: Combine data from related tables:
  - `FLIGHT` with `AIRLINE` to get airline names,
  - `FLIGHT` with `FLIGHT_STOP` for more details,
  - `FARE` to include cost information,
  - `CITY` for the departure and arrival locations.
- **WHERE** clause:
  - Filters results to include only flights from Baltimore to San Francisco.
  - Filters based on the day of the week (Friday).
  - Filters departure times for Friday nights (after 6 PM).
- **ORDER BY**: Orders results by the departure time for better readability.

### Note:
- Ensure that the formats in the `FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME` field allow proper extraction of hours as shown.
- Adjust the logic capturing times to suit your database's specific formats.
- The above query assumes that departure times are stored in a `HH:MM` format. Adjust parsing if the format is different.

Raw LLM Response:
To answer the question regarding whether a meal is served on the earliest flight from San Francisco to Atlanta on Delta Airlines (DL), we need to utilize the database schema provided. We'll follow these steps in our SQL query:

1. Identify the airport codes for San Francisco and Atlanta.
2. Find the earliest flight from SAN (San Francisco) to ATL (Atlanta) for the airline DL.
3. Check if any meal is associated with that flight.

Here’s how you can write the SQL query for this task:

```sql
-- First, we will identify the airport codes for San Francisco and Atlanta
-- In practice, we might directly know them as SAN and ATL respectively.

-- Then we will find the earliest flight and check for meal service.
SELECT 
    fs.MEAL_CODE,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SAN' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
    AND a.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
        SELECT MIN(DEPARTURE_TIME)
        FROM FLIGHT 
        WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'SAN' 
        AND TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
        AND AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'
    );
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **FROM_Flight**: We're joining the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flight details.
- **JOIN AIRLINE**: This joins the `AIRLINE` table to filter for Delta Airlines (DL).
- **JOIN FOOD_SERVICE**: This joins the `FOOD_SERVICE` table using `MEAL_CODE` to determine meal details.
- **WHERE clause**: This filters for flights specifically flying from SAN to ATL and operated by Delta Airlines.
- **Subquery**: The subquery retrieves the minimum `DEPARTURE_TIME` for the filtered flights to find the earliest one.

### Outcome:
The main SELECT statement returns the meal code and description if a meal is served on the earliest flight. If no meal is served, the query will return no results.

-- First, we will identify the airport codes for San Francisco and Atlanta
-- In practice, we might directly know them as SAN and ATL respectively.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the departure time of the latest flight from Denver (DEN) to Boston (BOS) operated by United Airlines (UA), you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you have access to the relevant tables, particularly the `FLIGHT` table. 

```sql
SELECT MAX(DEPARTURE_TIME) AS Latest_Departure_Time
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' 
  AND FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the maximum `DEPARTURE_TIME` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We filter the results by specifying the airline code for United Airlines (`'UA'`), the departure airport (`'DEN'` for Denver), and the arrival airport (`'BOS'` for Boston). 

The result will give you the latest departure time for flights operated by United Airlines from Denver to Boston.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the latest flight on Wednesday that leaves from Oakland to Salt Lake City offering a meal, you will need to join several tables from the database schema, including those that contain flight information and meal information.

Assuming that:
- OAKLAND airport code is represented by its respective airport code in the AIRPORT table.
- SALT LAKE CITY airport code is represented similarly.

Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT_ARRIVAL.AIRPORT_CODE AS TO_AIRPORT,
    FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE ON FLIGHT.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS ON DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday'
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', DAYS.DAYS_CODE, '%')
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Selects relevant columns including flight number, airline code, departure time, and meal description.
  
2. **JOINs**: Joins multiple tables:
   - Joins with the AIRPORT table to find flights departing from Oakland and arriving at Salt Lake City.
   - Joins with the FOOD_SERVICE table to ensure meals are offered.
   - Joins with the DAYS table to filter flights only on Wednesdays.
   
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City specifically on Wednesdays.

4. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by departure time in descending order to get the latest flight first.

5. **LIMIT 1**: Returns the single latest flight that matches the criteria.

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_NAME` conditions based on the actual representations in your database if they differ.

Question: please show me the cost of flight UA 201 from BOSTON to DENVER and flight UA 343 from BOSTON to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number0 OR FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_NUMBER = flight_number1 ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the cost of flight UA 201 and flight UA 343 from Boston to Denver, we need to join several tables to get the required information. The essential tables we'll use are `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`. Below is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    FARE ON FF.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA' AND 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER IN ('201', '343') AND
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON') AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'DENVER');
```

### Explanation of the query:

1. **Select Clause**: We're selecting the flight number, from and to airports, as well as the costs (one way and round trip) based on the joins.

2. **From Clause**: The query starts from the `FLIGHT` table, denoting it as `F`.

3. **Joins**:
   - We join `FLIGHT_FARE` using the `FLIGHT_ID` column to get the fare details associated with the flight.
   - We then join the `FARE` table to actually retrieve the costs associated with those fares.

4. **Where Clause**: The conditions filter flights that are operated by 'UA' (United Airlines) and have flight numbers '201' or '343'. Additionally, we are filtering for flights specifically departing from and arriving at Boston and Denver, respectively. The `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields are resolved by subqueries that look up the airport codes in the `AIRPORT` table. 

Make sure that the airport codes for Boston and Denver are known in the database or that they can be accurately retrieved by the subquery. If you already know the airport codes, you can hard-code them directly in the `WHERE` clause for efficiency.

Question: what ground transportation is available from the PITTSBURGH airport to downtown and how much does it cost
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.GROUND_FARE , GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias1.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the available ground transportation from Pittsburgh airport (let's assume the airport code for Pittsburgh is "PIT", and you can also check the database for the exact code), you would likely query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table that relates to the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to filter down to the specific location and transportation type.

Here’s an SQL query to get the available ground transportation from Pittsburgh Airport to downtown along with its costs:

```sql
SELECT 
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    G.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON G.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT' 
    AND C.CITY_NAME = 'Pittsburgh';
```

This query selects the type of ground transportation and the corresponding fare from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table where the airport code matches 'PIT' for Pittsburgh and filters for the appropriate city. Be sure to replace 'PIT' and 'Pittsburgh' with the correct identifier used in your database if they differ.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list all nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh that arrive before 17:00 on Tuesday, we would need to write a SQL query that joins several tables based on their relationships. 

Here's a SQL query that could fulfill the requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_FROM ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_TO ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES' 
    AND AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH'
    AND FLIGHT.STOPS = 0  -- Nonstop flights
    AND DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday'
    AND CAST(FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME AS TIME) < '17:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We select flight details such as the airline code, flight number, departure time, arrival time, number of stops, and the airport names.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Los Angeles) and once for the arrival airport (Pittsburgh).
- We filter the results:
  - The departure airport must be "LOS ANGELES".
  - The arrival airport must be "PITTSBURGH".
  - The number of stops should be zero, ensuring we only get nonstop flights.
  - We assume there's a relation to get the day of the week for flights, and we filter it to Tuesday.
  - Finally, we ensure the arrival time is before 17:00:00.

Note: Depending on how the day of the week is structured in your schema, the condition for checking Tuesday (`DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday'`) might need to be adjusted based on how days are represented (for example, it could depend on the `FLIGHT_DAYS` or similar columns).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Las Vegas (LAS) to New York (NYC) operated by Trans World Airlines (TW), along with the fare information, you can use the SQL query below. The query assumes you need to join the relevant tables based on the schema you've provided. This includes filters for the departure and arrival airports, airline code, and flight connections. 

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.STOPS, 
    f.TIME_ELAPSED, 
    f.DUAL_CARRIER,
    fare.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'NYC'
    AND f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'TW'
    AND f.STOPS = 0;  -- Nonstop flights have 0 stops
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: We select columns from the `FLIGHT` table that provide flight details, as well as fare information from the `FARE` table.
  
2. **JOINs**: 
   - Join `FLIGHT` with `FLIGHT_FARE` on the `FLIGHT_ID` to get fare details related to the flights.
   - Join `FLIGHT_FARE` with `FARE` to access fare costs and details.
  
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - We filter for flights departing from Las Vegas (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS'`) and arriving in New York (`TO_AIRPORT = 'NYC'`).
   - We specify that the airline is Trans World Airlines (`AIRLINE_CODE = 'TW'`).
   - Finally, we ensure that the flight is a nonstop flight by checking that the number of stops is zero (`STOPS = 0`).

Make sure that the airport codes for New York are correctly specified (e.g., it could be `JFK`, `LGA`, etc.) depending on your data. You may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest round trip fare from Atlanta (ATL) to Baltimore/Washington (BWI), you need to join the relevant tables, specifically the `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, `FLIGHT`, and potentially other tables to pull the necessary attributes.

Here is a proposed SQL query to find the lowest round trip fare:

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Lowest_Round_Trip_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN FLIGHT fare_flight ON f.FARE_ID = fare_flight.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI'
  AND f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table `FARE`**: This table contains the fare information including round trip costs.
2. **Table `FLIGHT`**: This is joined to ensure that we are only looking at flights that can match the fare.
3. **Filtering**:
   - The conditions in the `WHERE` clause ensure that only fares from Atlanta (ATL) to Baltimore/Washington (BWI) are considered.
   - It also checks if the fare is specifically for round trips (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).
4. **Aggregation**: The `MIN` function retrieves the lowest round trip fare based on the filtered results.

### Note:
- Adjust the join condition if needed, based on your actual schema relationships. The `FLIGHT` table is presumed to hold a linkage to the `FARE` table through `FLIGHT_ID`. If another joining condition is needed, please modify accordingly.
- Ensure that the spelling and codes for airports are correct from the respective tables in the database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT MIN(f.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Lowest_Round_Trip_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN FLIGHT fare_flight ON f.FARE_ID = fare_flight.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ATL' 
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI'
  AND f.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest non-stop flight from WASHINGTON to SAN FRANCISCO on a Friday, we need to join several tables in the database schema. 

Here's a sample SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    A_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' AND
    A_TO.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO' AND
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Friday' AND
    F.STOPS = 0
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. **JOINs**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter flights based on their originating and destination airports (WASHINGTON and SAN FRANCISCO).
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filter for flights from WASHINGTON (`A_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'`).
   - Filter for flights to SAN FRANCISCO (`A_TO.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'`).
   - Filter for flights on Friday (`D.DAY_NAME = 'Friday'`).
   - Ensure the flight has no stops (`F.STOPS = 0`).
4. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sort the results by departure time to find the earliest flight.
5. **LIMIT Clause**: Only return the first result, which is the earliest non-stop flight.

Make sure to replace any table or field names if they differ in your actual schema.

Question: i need an early flight from MILWAUKEE to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find an early flight from Milwaukee to Denver, you would need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you would look into the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, and potentially other related tables to filter and display the earliest flights for the specified route. Below is an example of an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FROM_AIRPORT.CITY_CODE = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS TO_CITY ON TO_AIRPORT.CITY_CODE = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER'
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;  -- This will give you the earliest flight
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects relevant columns, including flight details and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source of data.
3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for departure and once for arrival) to get airport names.
   - Joins the `CITY` table twice to enforce the filtering based on city names for Milwaukee and Denver.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights from Milwaukee to Denver.
5. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by the departure time to ensure the earliest flight is at the top.
6. **LIMIT**: Limits the results to just one, which will be the earliest flight.

Make sure to adjust any field names as needed based on your actual database schema or requirements.

Question: please list afternoon flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the afternoon flights from St. Petersburg to Charlotte, we need to use the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve flight details based on the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and destination airport (`TO_AIRPORT`). We also need to ensure that only flights departing in the afternoon are included, which typically is between 12:00 PM (noon) and 5:59 PM.

From your database schema, we'll assume the airport codes for St. Petersburg and Charlotte are known (e.g., `PIE` for St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and `CLT` for Charlotte Douglas International Airport). 

Here is the SQL query to retrieve the desired information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AC.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT AC ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = AC.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIE' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'CLT' 
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12 
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18;
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant columns including flight number, arrival time, departure time, airline name, and aircraft description.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` and `AIRCRAFT` tables to get additional information about the flights.
- Filter the results to only include flights that depart from St. Petersburg (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIE'`), arrive in Charlotte (`TO_AIRPORT = 'CLT'`), and have departure times in the afternoon (`HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12 AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18`). 

Make sure to replace `PIE` and `CLT` with the correct codes if different, and adjust the logic for the time condition based on your database's time format.

To list flights from Chicago to Kansas City in the morning, you'll need to access the `FLIGHT` table to filter for flights that depart from Chicago (using the appropriate airport code) and arrive in Kansas City (using its airport code). Additionally, you'll want to filter the flights that have a departure time indicating "morning" (typically before noon, but you can define a morning range as needed).

Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Chicago')
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Kansas City')
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The inner subqueries for `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` use the `AIRPORT` table to find the relevant airport codes for Chicago and Kansas City.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights to only include those that depart from Chicago and arrive in Kansas City, and it checks that the departure time is less than 12:00 PM.
- Finally, results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` for better clarity on flight timings. 

Ensure your database has the necessary airport names for the subqueries to return valid airport codes. You can also replace the time condition if you have a specific morning time frame in mind.

Question: can i have a morning flight from BALTIMORE to NEWARK please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a morning flight from Baltimore to Newark, you would need to query the `FLIGHT` table, using the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` fields to filter flights from Baltimore to Newark. Additionally, a morning flight is generally defined as one that departs between 12:00 AM and 11:59 AM. 

Here’s how you could write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'BALTIMORE' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'NEWARK' 
  AND DEPARTURE_TIME >= '00:00:00' 
  AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

Make sure to replace 'BALTIMORE' and 'NEWARK' with the actual airport codes (if they have specific codes in your database) or adapt the field names if necessary. This query selects all details of flights that meet these criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the morning flights from Memphis to New York, we will need to access several tables in the database schema, primarily focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to filter for the appropriate flights based on departure times and locations.

Here's an example SQL query that can achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' 
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 6 AND 11; -- Filter for morning flights (6 AM to 11 AM)
```

### Explanation of the query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to be retrieved, including `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_NAME`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates the `FLIGHT` table as the primary data source.

3. **JOIN Clauses**:
   - Joins the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline's name.
   - Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Memphis) and once for the arrival airport (New York).

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights departing from 'MEMPHIS' and arriving at 'NEW YORK'.
   - Uses the `EXTRACT` function to get the hour component of `DEPARTURE_TIME` and limits it to morning hours (6 AM to 11 AM).

Adjust the airport names in the WHERE clause as per your actual database records if they differ. Also, ensure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` uses a suitable timestamp type for the `EXTRACT` function to work correctly.

Question: i want a flight from LOS ANGELES to CHARLOTTE early in the morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Los Angeles to Charlotte that departs early in the morning, you can run the following SQL query. This query assumes that you're looking for flights with departure times between 5 AM and 12 PM. Here, I will assume `FROM_AIRPORT` corresponds to the airport code for Los Angeles and `TO_AIRPORT` corresponds to the airport code for Charlotte.

First, you'll need to replace `'LAX'` and `'CLT'` with the actual airport codes for Los Angeles and Charlotte, respectively. Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
       FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
       FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
       FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
       FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
       FLIGHT.STOPS,
       AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
       AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
       DEST_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = DEPARTURE_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS DEST_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = DEST_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAX'   -- Replace 'LAX' with the actual airport code for Los Angeles
  AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'CLT'      -- Replace 'CLT' with the actual airport code for Charlotte
  AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '12:00:00'
ORDER BY FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves relevant flight information such as airline codes, flight times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- **JOINs**: Connects the different tables (FLIGHT, AIRLINE, AIRPORT) using appropriate foreign keys (e.g., `FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE`).
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to flights departing from Los Angeles (`'LAX'`) to Charlotte (`'CLT'`) and limits the departure times to the morning period (5 AM to 12 PM).
- **ORDER BY**: Orders the results based on the departure time in ascending order.

Make sure to replace the airport codes with the correct ones from your database if they differ.

Question: i would like a morning flight from CHARLOTTE to NEWARK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a morning flight from CHARLOTTE (CLT) to NEWARK (EWR), you'll typically want to consider the following aspects in your SQL query:

1. Identify the appropriate airport codes for CHARLOTTE and NEWARK.
2. Find flights that have a departure time during the morning hours (commonly defined as 6:00 AM to 11:59 AM).
3. Join various necessary tables to provide comprehensive flight information.

Here is an example SQL query that fulfills your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'CLT' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'EWR' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve. Here, we're selecting the flight number, airline name, departure and arrival times, number of stops, connections, flight days, and time elapsed.
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Indicates the primary table from which to retrieve the flight information, aliased as `F`.
- `JOIN AIRLINE A`: Joins the AIRLINE table to get the airline name associated with the flight, aliased as `A`.
- `WHERE`: Applies conditions to filter the results:
  - Ensures the flight is departing from CHARLOTTE (`CLT`) and arriving at NEWARK (`EWR`).
  - Filters the departure time to include only morning flights (between 6 AM and 11:59 AM).

### Note:
- Ensure that you have the correct airport codes for CHARLOTTE and NEWARK in your database.
- Depending on the format of the `DEPARTURE_TIME` field, you might need to adjust the time format in the `WHERE` clause if your system uses a different time representation (e.g., including date or using a different clock format).

Question: i'd like a morning flight from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a morning flight from Newark to Los Angeles, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that a "morning flight" is defined as a flight that departs between 6:00 AM (06:00) and 11:59 AM (11:59 AM). 

Please adjust the time intervals as necessary to fit your specific definition of a morning flight.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    a.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'NEWARK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'LOS ANGELES'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '06:00:00'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME <= '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting fields that provide useful information about the flight like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, and the airline details.
- We join the `FLIGHT` and `AIRLINE` tables on their common field `AIRLINE_CODE` to get the airline name.
- We filter the results to include only flights departing from Newark to Los Angeles and within the specified morning time range.
  
### Note:
Ensure that the `From_Airport` and `To_Airport` fields in the `FLIGHT` table use the correct airport codes or names as they are represented in your database, which may not be explicitly shown here. Depending on your database, you may need to verify the exact names or codes for Newark and Los Angeles airports.

Question: i'd like an evening flight from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To get the details of an evening flight from Newark (EWR - New Jersey) to Los Angeles (LAX - California), you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that you are looking for flights that depart after a certain time (e.g., 5 PM) and that you want the relevant details about the flights, including flight number, airline, and departure/arrival times.

Here is an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'EWR' AND 
    A2.CITY_CODE = 'LAX' AND 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 17; -- 17 is 5 PM in 24-hour time
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection of Columns**: The query selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the airport names from the relevant tables.
2. **Table Joins**: We use JOINs to link the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT table for both the departure and arrival airports.
3. **Conditions**: It filters for flights from Newark (identified by its airport code) to Los Angeles and specifies that the flights should depart after 5 PM.

### Notes:
- Replace `EWR` and `LAX` with the appropriate city codes or airport codes if they differ.
- The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 17` checks for evening flights. Adjust the timing as needed based on your definition of evening.
- Ensure your database supports the `EXTRACT` function; otherwise, you might need to adjust the time format based on how the data is stored.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a one-way ticket from Milwaukee to Orlando for either Wednesday evening or Thursday morning, you will need to join several tables. The primary tables you would be concerned with are:

1. **FLIGHT** - for flight details.
2. **AIRPORT** - to get the airport codes for Milwaukee and Orlando.
3. **DATE_DAY** - to filter the days you are interested in (Wednesday and Thursday).

Here’s how you might structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = DD.DAY_NUMBER
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    ((DD.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '18:00:00') OR 
     (DD.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday' AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'))
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- **SELECT Statement**: This part selects the relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table and airport names from the `AIRPORT` table.
  
- **JOINs**: 
  - The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice: once for the departure city (Milwaukee) and once for the arrival city (Orlando).
  - The `DATE_DAY` table is joined to filter the flight days (Wednesday and Thursday).

- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - The first condition checks that the departure airport is Milwaukee, and the arrival airport is Orlando.
  - The second condition checks the flight times: 
    - For Wednesday, it ensures the departure time is in the evening (after 6 PM).
    - For Thursday, it ensures the departure time is in the morning (before 12 PM).

- **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by departure time to present the closest available flights first.

Make sure to adapt any specific conditions or adjustments based on the actual data structure, as field names and types may vary slightly within the context of your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip flights from Burbank (BUR) to Seattle (SEA) that arrive before 1900 (7:00 PM) in Seattle, we would typically need to join several of the tables from the provided schema to ensure that we get the necessary details, including the flight ID, arrival times, and fare information. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '1900' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a round trip
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: We're working with the FLIGHT table and giving it the alias `f` for easier reference.
- **JOIN FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID**: This joins the FLIGHT table with the FARE table to ensure we can filter based on the fare requirements, specifically for round trip costs.
- **WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR' AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'**: We're filtering flights that depart from Burbank and arrive in Seattle.
- **AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '1900'**: Ensures we only get flights that arrive in Seattle before 7 PM.
- **AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'**: Filters to ensure that we are only looking at round-trip flights. Adjust the condition based on the actual values used in your database if different.

Make sure to validate the actual data types and values used in your database schema, especially for times and round-trip indications, as they might use formats or values that differ from the assumptions made here.

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.CONNECTIONS > connections0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a connecting flight from Dallas (DALLAS) to San Francisco (SAN FRANCISCO) leaving after 4:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you are using the relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table, and that appropriate joins exist for airports and cities:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO')
    AND CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) > '04:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We select relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, and departure/arrival times.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice; once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
- We filter `CITY_CODE` for both the FROM and TO airports based on the specified city names.
- We check that the departure time is after 4:00 AM by converting `DEPARTURE_TIME` to a `TIME` format.

Make sure to adjust column names as per your database conventions if necessary, especially for time formats.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the FIRST class and COACH flights between JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and ORLANDO (Orlando International Airport), you need to join several tables in the database schema provided. Specifically, you'll be interested in the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables to filter the flights based on the requested classes.

Here's an SQL query that should accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fb.BOOKING_CLASS,
    fb.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ORLANDO'
    AND (fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F' OR fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'C') -- Assuming 'F' for First Class and 'C' for Coach
    AND fb.CLASS_TYPE IN ('FIRST', 'COACH'); -- Filter by class types
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant flight details and cost information using multiple joins:
  - `FLIGHT` table for flight details including numbers and times.
  - `FLIGHT_FARE` to link flights to their fare IDs.
  - `FARE` table for pricing information associated with each flight.
  - `FARE_BASIS` to get the class of service.
  
- The `WHERE` clause filters the flights to only those that depart from JFK and arrive in ORLANDO, and also restricts the results to FIRST class and COACH based on `BOOKING_CLASS` and `CLASS_TYPE`. Here, it's assumed that 'F' represents First Class and 'C' represents Coach – these codes may vary based on the actual implementation, so adjust as necessary.

Feel free to tweak the SQL as needed to match any specific coding conventions or requirements in your setup!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first-class and coach flights from JFK airport to Miami, you can utilize a JOIN operation across the relevant tables. The following SQL query demonstrates how to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FARE ON FF.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE C ON FB.BOOKING_CLASS = C.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' 
    AND (C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'First Class' OR C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Coach');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Clause**: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve, including flight number, departure and arrival times, airline name, class description, and fare cost.
2. **From Clause**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `F`).
3. **Join Clauses**: 
   - Join `AIRLINE` to get the airline name.
   - Join `FLIGHT_FARE` and then `FARE` to associate flight details with their fare information.
   - Finally, join `FARE_BASIS` and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` to filter based on class descriptions (First Class and Coach).
4. **Where Clause**: Filters flights specifically from JFK airport to Miami (MIA) and checks that the class is either First Class or Coach.

Make sure to adjust the class description strings as per your actual database entries, as case sensitivity might affect the results.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first class and coach flights from JFK to Miami, you will likely need to join multiple tables to get the necessary information, including `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and possibly others to filter by the specific airports and fare classes. Here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIMES_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FB.BOOKING_CLASS,
    FB.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' AND
    (FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F' OR FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'Y')  -- Assuming 'F' for First Class and 'Y' for Coach
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Fields**: We select relevant columns such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, total travel time, costs from fare, booking class, and class type.
- **Joins**: The query joins `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` to connect flights to their respective fares and fare classifications.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters for flights that depart from JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and arrive at MIA (Miami International Airport).
- **Booking Class**: The query filters to include only first class (assumed 'F') and coach (assumed 'Y') tickets based on the booking class.
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to list flights in chronological order. 

Make sure to adjust the booking class representation ('F', 'Y') if they differ in your specific database schema.

Question: are meals ever served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if meals are served on flights ('FF' could refer to a specific flight class or category), we can check the `FLIGHT` table for flights that utilize a 'MEAL_CODE'. We can then join it with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to see if there are meal descriptions associated with those meal codes.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
WHERE
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER LIKE 'FF%'
    OR f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'FF';  -- Replace 'FF' with the specific condition if needed
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the distinct flight IDs, airline codes, flight numbers, and meal descriptions.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table using the `MEAL_CODE`.
- We filter the results for flight numbers that match 'FF'.

Make sure to adjust the `LIKE` clause as needed based on how you expect 'FF' to be formatted in the flight numbers. If 'FF' is the exact flight number and it appears as such, the query will catch it with the `=` condition.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
WHERE
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER LIKE 'FF%'
    OR f.FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'FF';  -- Replace 'FF' with the specific condition if needed

Raw LLM Response:
To find the least expensive fare from Boston to Salt Lake City, you'll need to join several tables based on the relationships between airports, fares, and flights. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT MIN(FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Least_Expensive_Fare
FROM FARE
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND 
      TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

This query:

1. Selects the minimum one-direction cost from the `FARE` table.
2. Joins the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Boston) and once for the destination airport (Salt Lake City).
3. Filters results to match the specified airport names.

Make sure that "BOSTON" and "SALT LAKE CITY" correspond to the actual values in your `AIRPORT` table. If airport codes are different, you'll need to adjust the conditions accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest fare from Charlotte to Las Vegas, you will need to access the relevant tables: `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT` to link the airports, and then get the minimum fare based on the conditions specified. Assuming that "CHARLOTTE" corresponds to the airport code "CLT" and "LAS VEGAS" corresponds to "LAS", here's the SQL query you might use:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%CHARLOTTE%' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%LAS VEGAS%'
ORDER BY 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be returned, including fare details.
- **FROM FARE F**: The main table being queried.
- **JOIN**: This is used to combine the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter by airport names.
- **WHERE**: Filters rows based on the condition that the originating airport is in Charlotte and the destination airport is in Las Vegas.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results by the one-way cost in ascending order, so the cheapest fare appears first.
- **LIMIT 1**: Restricts the result to only the cheapest fare. 

Make sure to replace the airport names in the query with their respective airport codes if you know them explicitly. In this case, the assumed system uses the airport codes directly for filtering.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest fares from Washington to Salt Lake City, you would typically join the relevant tables to determine the appropriate fare and its associated flight information. The tables involved would likely be `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially others for additional filtering.

Assuming that "WASHINGTON" refers to a specific airport (for instance, DCA for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport or IAD for Dulles International Airport), and you know the respective airport codes for WASHINGTON and SALT LAKE CITY (SLC), here’s a SQL query that could help you find the lowest fares:

### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%'
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%'
ORDER BY 
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;  -- Assuming we want only the lowest fare
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight number and the costs for one-way and round-trip fares along with the airport names for clarity.
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - `FLIGHT` provides flight details.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` connects flights to their fares.
   - `FARE` contains the actual fare pricing information.
   - `AIRPORT` provides names for the origin and destination airports.
3. **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters records to only include flights originating from Washington and going to Salt Lake City.
4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by the one-way cost in ascending order, and limited to just one result (the lowest fare).

Make sure to replace the `LIKE '%...%'` conditions and adjust the queries as appropriate to fit your database's naming conventions and known airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest fare from BWI (Baltimore/Washington International Airport) to Salt Lake City, you need to join multiple tables in your database schema. This will involve the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables primarily, since the `FARE` table contains the fare information we need, and the `AIRPORT` table will provide the airport codes for BWI and Salt Lake City.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Lowest_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BWI'
AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Salt Lake City';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FROM` clause includes `FARE` as the main table we want to query.
- We join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the details of the departure airport (BWI) and once to get details of the arrival airport (Salt Lake City).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results so only fares from BWI to Salt Lake City are considered.
- `MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST)` is used to find the lowest fare for the selected route. 

Make sure that the airport name for Salt Lake City matches what is in your database (this query assumes there's only one match). Adjust the table and column names as necessary if they differ in your actual schema.

Question: what ground transportation is available from LGA airport into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query the available ground transportation from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) into New York City, we need to retrieve information from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, along with the relevant `AIRPORT` and `CITY` information. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    gs.GROUND_FARE,
    a.AIRPORT_NAME,
    c.CITY_NAME
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON gs.AIRPORT_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' 
    AND c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

### Explanation of the query:
- The query selects the transport type and ground fare from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT` table to ensure we are only dealing with the specified airport (LGA).
- It also joins the `CITY` table to filter by `NEW YORK`.
- The `WHERE` clause is used to narrow the results to only those services related to LaGuardia Airport and the city of New York.

Make sure to replace `'LGA'` and `'NEW YORK'` with the exact values if needed, considering the actual data present in the tables.

Question: is there ground transportation from LGA into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is ground transportation from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to New York City, you would need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which links cities, airports, transport types, and fares. Assuming "NEW YORK" corresponds to a specific `CITY_CODE` in the `CITY` table, you can write a SQL query to check for any entries in `GROUND_SERVICE` that link LGA to New York.

Here's a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, gs.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE gs.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

In this query:

- We are selecting transportation types (`TRANSPORT_TYPE`) and fares (`GROUND_FARE`).
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` table to filter for services that are related to New York City.
- We filter the results by specifying that the `AIRPORT_CODE` must be 'LGA' and the `CITY_NAME` must be 'NEW YORK'.

When you run this query, it will return the types of ground transportation available from LGA to New York City along with their corresponding fares. If the result set is empty, it indicates that there is no ground transportation listed.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, gs.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE gs.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';

Question: please list ground transportation from EWR into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "EWR" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list ground transportation from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) into New York City, you should query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, filtering for records where the `AIRPORT_CODE` is 'EWR' and the `CITY_CODE` corresponds to a city in New York (such as 'NYC' or the appropriate code used in your database for New York City). 

You may also want to join with the `CITY` table to filter by city name or similarly connect data if necessary.

Here is an example SQL query to retrieve ground transportation details from EWR into New York:

```sql
SELECT GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GS.GROUND_FARE, C.CITY_NAME
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE GS.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR' AND C.CITY_NAME = 'New York';
```

Please ensure that `CITY_CODE` corresponds to the actual code used in your database for New York, as this is usually specific to the database design. You might need to adjust the WHERE clause based on the actual city representation in your `CITY` table (for example, if 'NEW YORK' is recorded differently).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE, GS.GROUND_FARE, C.CITY_NAME

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights on MONDAY that travel from Charlotte, North Carolina (CLT) to Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), you need to join relevant tables and filter by the specified criteria. Here’s how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.STOPS, 
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl ON fl.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Charlotte' 
    AND a_from.STATE_CODE = 'NC'
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Phoenix' 
    AND a_to.STATE_CODE = 'AZ'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to retrieve (flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, stops, and travel time).
2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT`, which includes details about each flight.
3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Join `AIRPORT` for both the departure (`a_from`) and arrival (`a_to`) locations to filter flights based on airport names and their state codes.
   - Join `FLIGHT_LEG` to ensure the relevant flight legs are included.
   - Join `DAYS` to filter by day of the week.
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters the flights to only those departing from Charlotte, NC (matching the airport name and state code).
   - Filters the flights to only those arriving in Phoenix, AZ (matching the airport name and state code).
   - Filters flights to include only those on Monday.

Make sure to replace the string comparisons for `AIRPORT_NAME` with the actual names used in the database if they are different. Additionally, ensure that appropriate indices exist for efficient querying in larger datasets.

Question: what are the nonstop flights between SAN JOSE and HOUSTON TEXAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "TEXAS" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find nonstop flights between San Jose and Houston, you'll need to retrieve data from the `FLIGHT` table to identify the relevant flights. You will also need to join the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for San Jose and Houston. Here’s how you can write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'San Jose')
    AND A_TO.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Houston')
    AND F.STOPS = 0;  -- Only nonstop flights
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- The `SELECT` clause retrieves necessary information about the flights, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, the number of stops, total time elapsed, and the names of departure and destination airports.
- The `FROM` clause indicates the `FLIGHT` table as the primary table to pull flight information from.
- The `JOIN` clauses link to the `AIRPORT` table twice—first to connect the departure airport and second to connect the arrival airport.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights that are:
  - Departing from San Jose (found by matching to the `CITY` table for the corresponding `CITY_CODE` of San Jose).
  - Arriving in Houston (also matched through the `CITY` table).
  - Nonstop flights, which are indicated by `F.STOPS = 0`.

Make sure to have appropriate access to execute this query on your database, and ensure that the CITY table contains accurate mappings for San Jose and Houston.

Raw LLM Response:
To find American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark (EWR) to Nashville (BNA) around 6:30 PM, you would need to construct an SQL query that selects relevant flight details, filters based on the departure airport, arrival airport, airline code, and time. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' AND -- Filter for American Airlines
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'EWR' AND -- Departure airport (Newark)
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BNA' AND -- Arrival airport (Nashville)
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:15:00' AND '18:45:00'; -- Filtering by time around 6:30 PM
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including flight details and airline name.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table and joins it with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name.
3. **JOIN**: Combines `FLIGHT` with `AIRLINE` using the `AIRLINE_CODE` foreign key.
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights of American Airlines (`A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'`).
   - Filters for flights departing from Newark (`F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'EWR'`).
   - Filters for flights arriving in Nashville (`F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BNA'`).
   - Filters for departure times that are around 6:30 PM (`F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:15:00' AND '18:45:00'`). Adjust this range if needed for precision.

You may need to adjust the date format or the time format according to your database settings and the actual schema if time is stored in a different format or datatype.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Tacoma, Washington (SEA or similar airport) with a stopover in San Francisco (SFO), and not exceeding $300 on the date June 10, 1993, you can use the following SQL query. Note that the actual city codes for Tacoma might differ; I've used generic codes based on typical airport codes.

Here’s how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare1.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fs1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = f1.FLIGHT_ID -- Assuming the return flight has similar structure
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = fs2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare1 ON ff.FARE_ID = fare1.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAX' 
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'SFO' 
    AND fs1.STOP_AIRPORT = 'SFO' 
    AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SFO'
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
    AND fare1.ROUND_TRIP_COST <= 300
    AND f1.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '1993-06-10 00:00:00' AND '1993-06-10 23:59:59'
    AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '1993-06-17 00:00:00' AND '1993-06-17 23:59:59' -- Assuming a return date of June 17, 1993
    AND fs2.STOP_AIRPORT = 'LAX'; -- Adding a back-stop in Los Angeles
```

### Notes:
1. **City and Airport Codes:** Adjust the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` codes appropriately. In this example, I used 'LAX' for Los Angeles, 'SFO' for San Francisco, and 'SEA' for Tacoma (which may need verifying for the specific airport you want).
2. **Flight Conditions:** The query assumes there is a return trip on June 17, 1993. You can change this to your desired return date.
3. **Cost Check:** Ensure that the checks on `ROUND_TRIP_COST` align in the way your application's pricing logic works. 
4. **Using JOINs:** The query assumes that the flight details are joined via `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FLIGHT_STOP`. 

Make sure to review and tailor this SQL statement based on your actual database schema and expected input values.
