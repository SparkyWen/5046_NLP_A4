Question: i need a flight from DENVER to SALT LAKE CITY on monday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver (DEN) to Salt Lake City (SLC) on Monday, you can use the following SQL query, assuming the relevant relationships between tables (such as airports and flights) have been established and the DAY_NAME for Monday is stored in the DAYS table. This example assumes that the necessary data (like airport codes and flight details) is available in your database schema.

Here's a SQL query that attempts to find those flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SLC' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Monday';
```

In this query:
- We select fields that we want to view from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` tables.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get airport names for both the departure and arrival airports. 
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `DAYS` table to filter for flights that operate on Monday.
- We filter results to those flights departing from Denver (DEN) and arriving at Salt Lake City (SLC). 

Make sure to run this in an environment where the schema and data are properly set up!

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Milwaukee (MKE) to San Jose (SJC) on Wednesday, you'll want to join several tables to gather the necessary details, including information about flights, airports, and the days of the week. Here's an SQL query that achieves this by assuming the relevant codes for Milwaukee and San Jose are MKE and SJC, respectively:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS FD ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = FD.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MKE' AND 
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SJC' AND 
    FD.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday';
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT F**: Main table holding flight information.
- **JOIN AIRLINE A**: Joins to get the airline name based on the airline code.
- **JOIN AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT**: Joins to get details of the departure airport (Milwaukee).
- **JOIN AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT**: Joins to get details of the arrival airport (San Jose).
- **JOIN FLIGHT_DAYS FD**: Assumed table that holds the mapping of flights to days of operation.
- **WHERE clause**: Filters for flights departing from Milwaukee to San Jose specifically on Wednesday.

Make sure to adjust the table structure or names (like `FLIGHT_DAYS`, if necessary) according to your actual schema as the schema provided does not explicitly mention a table associated with flight days.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from San Jose to Dallas on Friday, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that you have the necessary relationships between tables established in your database schema, such as the mappings of cities to airports and the flight schedules associated with the days of the week.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.CITY_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.CITY_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0  -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS stores valid day codes
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'SAN JOSE' AND 
    C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Friday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns you want in the output, such as airline code, flight number, departure time, and arrival time.
2. **FROM**: Starts the selection from the `FLIGHT` table.
3. **JOIN**: Joins relevant tables to get city names for departure and arrival:
   - `AIRPORT` to get the departure and arrival airports.
   - `CITY` to filter based on city names.
   - `DAYS` to get the day of the week.
4. **WHERE**: Filters for flights that originate from "SAN JOSE" and arrive at "DALLAS", specifically on "Friday".

Make sure your database has appropriate indexing on these fields for better performance and that the actual column definitions used in the query (like `FLIGHT_DAYS`) match those in your database schema.

Question: list flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS on monday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Indianapolis to Memphis on Monday, you would typically need to filter the `FLIGHT` table based on the departure and arrival airports, as well as the day of the week. You might also need to check other related tables for the correct codes for the airports and the day.

Assuming we have the airport codes for Indianapolis and Memphis, we would construct the SQL query as follows. For this example, let’s say the airport code for Indianapolis is "IND" and for Memphis is "MEM". Also, we would assume that "MONDAY" is stored in the `DAYS` table.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS FD ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FD.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FD.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IND' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MEM' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY';
```

Here's a breakdown of the query:
- We select relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FLIGHT_DAYS` table to get the details about which days the flights operate.
- We join with the `DAYS` table to filter down to only those flights that operate on Monday.
- Finally, we filter for flights from Indianapolis ('IND') to Memphis ('MEM'). 

Make sure that the airport codes and the day names are correct per the respective tables in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from MEMPHIS to MIAMI on Wednesday, you need to join several tables in your database schema, primarily: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `DAYS`. You will also need to filter the flights based on the departure airport and arrival airport, as well as the day of the week. Here is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI' AND
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to return, including flight details and airport names.
2. **FROM and JOINs**: 
   - Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get details about the departure and arrival airports.
   - Joins the `CITY` table to relate airports to their respective cities.
   - Joins the `DAYS` table to filter flights by the day of the week.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from MEMPHIS to MIAMI on Wednesday.

Before running this SQL query, ensure that your table and column names are correct and adjust them if necessary (e.g., if the table relationships differ).

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Miami to Indianapolis on Sundays from the given database schema, you would use a SQL query that joins relevant tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS`. You would filter the results based on the specific departure and arrival airports.

Here's how you can write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG FL ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FL.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = FL.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT` clause retrieves specific columns like flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
- `JOIN` statements connect the relevant tables based on relationships (e.g., linking flights to their originating and destination airports, and days of the week).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights that depart from "MIAMI" and arrive at "INDIANAPOLIS" on a "SUNDAY".
  
Adjust the column selections as needed based on additional information that you may want to retrieve or display in the results.

Question: list flights from MINNEAPOLIS to PITTSBURGH on friday
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh on a Friday, you will need to take the following steps in your SQL query:

1. Identify the airport codes for Minneapolis and Pittsburgh.
2. Filter the flights for the specified departure and arrival airports.
3. Filter the flights based on the specific day of the week (Friday).

Here is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS FD ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = FD.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Minneapolis' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' AND 
    FD.DAY_NAME = 'Friday';
```

In this query:

- We are joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Minneapolis) and once for the arrival airport (Pittsburgh).
- We also join with a `FLIGHT_DAYS` table (assuming this correlates with `DAYS` to find the day of the week).
- We filter for the records where the departure airport is Minneapolis and the arrival airport is Pittsburgh, ensuring that the day of the week is Friday.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Baltimore to San Francisco on Friday, you need to join the relevant tables to extract the necessary information. The key tables involved here are `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` to filter by weekdays. 

Here's the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG FL ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FL.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FL.STOP_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE  -- Assuming STOP_DAYS is linked to DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Baltimore' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Francisco'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Friday';
```

### Explanation:
- **JOIN Operations**: 
   - Join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   - Join with `FLIGHT_LEG` and `DAYS` to filter the flights based on the day of the week (Friday).
  
- **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filter for flights departing from 'Baltimore' and arriving at 'San Francisco'.
   - Ensure the flights are on 'Friday'.

NOTE: You may need to adjust field names in the JOIN clause depending on how `STOP_DAYS` is represented in your schema as it wasn't directly defined in the tables provided. Make sure to check how days are related in your database design, especially if there's an additional link to correlate days of flights.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh on Tuesday, you will need to join several tables from the provided database schema. The primary tables involved in this query would be the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` tables. 

For this query, we'll assume that:
- The airport code for Los Angeles is `LAX`.
- The airport code for Pittsburgh is `PIT`.
- The `DAYS` table provides information on the day of the week.

Here's your SQL query to get the desired information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.DEAD_TIME,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LAX' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday';
```

In this query:
1. We select various columns of interest from the `FLIGHT` table and the `AIRPORT` table.
2. We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Los Angeles) and once for the destination airport (Pittsburgh).
3. We join the `DAYS` table to filter the flights specifically for Tuesday.
4. The `WHERE` clause specifies the airport codes for Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, as well as filtering for Tuesday flights. 

Make sure to adjust the airport codes `'LAX'` and `'PIT'` if the codes are different in your actual database.

Question: i need a friday flight from NEWARK to TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To fetch flights from Newark (EWR) to Tampa (TPA) specifically on Fridays, you would typically join several tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS`, along with any other necessary tables to gather all relevant flight information. Here's an example SQL query to find such flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS fd ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fd.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fd.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'TPA' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Friday';
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects flight details such as the flight number, airline code, departure time, corresponding arrival time, and the number of stops.
2. The `FROM` clause joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Newark) and once for the arrival airport (Tampa).
3. The `FLIGHT_DAYS` table is used to link the flight schedule with days of operation, while the `DAYS` table provides the actual day names.
4. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only flights departing from Newark (EWR), arriving at Tampa (TPA), and specifically on Fridays.

Make sure to adjust any specific column names or table structures based on your actual database setup or naming conventions.

Question: i need a sunday flight from TAMPA to CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a Sunday flight from Tampa to Charlotte using the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that the `FLIGHT` table contains the necessary route information (i.e., FROM_AIRPORT and TO_AIRPORT) and does not prioritize specific flight attributes such as fare or meal services.

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID, f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.AIRLINE_CODE, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, f.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TAMPA' 
  AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE'
  AND d.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting necessary details like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the full airport names for both the departure (Tampa) and arrival (Charlotte).
- We join with the `DAYS` table to filter flights that operate on Sundays.
- The condition uses `=` to check for the specific airport names and day of the week. Adjust the condition if needed based on actual airport codes or naming conventions in your database.

Please ensure you have the correct airport codes for Tampa and Charlotte if they're stored differently in your `AIRPORT` table.

Question: CHARLOTTE to BALTIMORE on tuesday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query that retrieves relevant flight information for flights from Charlotte to Baltimore on Tuesday, we need to join several tables based on the relationships defined in the schema. Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fl.LEG_NUMBER,
    c.CLASS_DESCRIPTION,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE c ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = c.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    (f.FLIGHT_DAYS & (1 << 2)) > 0  -- Bitmask for Tuesday (assuming 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, etc.)
    AND a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Charlotte'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Baltimore';
```

### Query Breakdown:
- **SELECT**: Chooses the columns of information we want to retrieve (flight number, departure and arrival times, airport names, class of service, and fare information).
- **FROM and JOINs**: This structure combines the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_LEG`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` tables using appropriate keys to relate them.
- **WHERE**: Applies two filters:
  - Checks if the flight operates on Tuesday by using a bitmask operation (assuming FLIGHT_DAYS is a bitmask where `1 << 2` represents Tuesday).
  - Filters the departure and arrival airports to be Charlotte and Baltimore respectively.

### Note:
1. Adjustments may be required depending on the specific structure of your data (e.g., if airport names or codes differ).
2. Ensure that the bitmask calculation aligns with how days are stored—further documentation on day representations might be necessary.
3. This query assumes that each fare is linked correctly to the respective flight, and that there exist fare entries for the flight on the specified route and day.

Raw LLM Response:
To generate SQL code for the flight information from Indianapolis to Orlando for the date December 27, you'll need to gather relevant data based on the relationships established in the schema. The required operations would involve the `FLIGHT` table to get flight details, while airports, routes, and dates could be fetched from the other corresponding tables.

Below is an example of how you might write an SQL query to find flights from Indianapolis (IND) to Orlando (ORL) for the specified date (December 27):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.DUAL_CARRIER
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY D ON D.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 AND D.DAY_NUMBER = 27 AND D.YEAR = [CURRENT_YEAR] -- Replace with the current year
WHERE 
    D.DAY_NAME IN (SELECT DAY_NAME FROM DAYS WHERE DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS)
    AND A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'IND' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ORL';
```

**Explanation of the Query:**
1. **SELECT**: Here, we are selecting several fields including flight number, airport names, departure and arrival times, and other pertinent details.
2. **FROM**: We start looking for flights in the `FLIGHT` table.
3. **JOINs**: We join with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get names for both the departure (Indianapolis) and arrival (Orlando) airports. We also join with the `DATE_DAY` table to ensure we are querying for flights scheduled on December 27 of the current year.
4. **WHERE**: 
   - We filter the results to show only flights that match the day of the week that corresponds with the flight days in the `FLIGHT` table.
   - We also filter the results for the relevant departure and arrival airports (`IND` for Indianapolis and `ORL` for Orlando).

Note: Replace `[CURRENT_YEAR]` with the actual year you are querying for. Depending on the actual database setup, additional considerations or adjustments may be needed with date formats or logic, especially if the flight data spans multiple years or if special cases for weekends or holidays are in play.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Milwaukee (MKE) to Phoenix (PHX) on Saturday, you will need to join multiple tables to gather the required information. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    r.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fa.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON fare.RESTRICTION_CODE = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT FROM_AIRPORT ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT TO_AIRPORT ON f.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee'
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Phoenix'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects various columns, including flight number, airline name, departure and arrival times, stop information, and fare data.
- It joins the `FLIGHT`, `FARE_FARE`, `AIRLINE`, `FARE`, `RESTRICTION`, and `DAYS` tables to get all relevant details for flights from Milwaukee to Phoenix.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for the departure airport being Milwaukee and the arrival airport being Phoenix and only selects flights that occur on a Saturday. 

You might need to adjust the `FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME` and `TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME` depending on how exactly Milwaukee and Phoenix are stored in your `AIRPORT` table. Also, ensure that the days are correctly mapped in your `DAYS` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for a trip from Phoenix to Milwaukee on a Sunday, you would typically want to join multiple tables. The SQL query needs to consider the relevant details from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` tables, along with potentially filtering for specific dates. Below is an SQL example that achieves this.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    d.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fs.STOP_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Phoenix') 
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Milwaukee') 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies what fields to retrieve, including flight ID, airline code, flight number, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
2. **JOIN Statements**: 
    - Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table for both the departure and destination airports.
    - Joins the `FLIGHT_STOP` to access the flight stop details.
    - Joins the `DAYS` table to filter based on the day of the week.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee and restricts results to those scheduled on Sundays. The subqueries look up city codes based on the city names.

Make sure that your actual data conforms to this schema and that you populate the necessary details for robust query performance. Adjust the field names as per your specific naming conventions if they differ.

    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AP.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AP WHERE AP.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE)

WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX'
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday';
```

### Explanation:
1. We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. We sub-select city codes to connect `CITY` with `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to find the corresponding airport codes.
3. We join the `DAYS` table to ensure that we only select flights that operate on Wednesday.
4. Filter conditions choose rows where the departure city is Phoenix and the destination city is Milwaukee.

### Note:
- Ensure that the actual `DAYS_CODE` for "Wednesday" exists and update it in the query accordingly if matches are based on that coded value.
- Depending on your database, `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT` table should match the `AIRPORT_CODE` in the `AIRPORT` table. You might want to check against actual airport codes for Phoenix and Milwaukee (e.g., PHX and MKE).
- Additional fields can be added based on required details such as fare information, meals, etc., by joining more tables as necessary.

Question: what are the flights between MEMPHIS and CINCINNATI on wednesday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights between Memphis and Cincinnati on a Wednesday, we will use the provided database schema. The relevant tables for this query include `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS`. We'll also need to ensure that we are filtering for the correct day.

Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI')
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT clause**: 
   - Specifies the fields we want to retrieve: flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **FROM and JOIN clauses**: 
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get full airport names for both the departure and arrival airports.
   - We join with the `DAYS` table to access the day name associated with the flights.

3. **WHERE clause**:
   - Filters for flights from Memphis (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and to Cincinnati (`TO_AIRPORT`), using subqueries to find the city codes.
   - Filters for flights that are scheduled on Wednesday (`DAY_NAME`). 

Adjust any necessary conditions as per your requirement or database specifics!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Kansas City to Chicago on a specific date (June 16), you'll need to join several tables to get the necessary information about flights, airports, and the date. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    FL.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON DD.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 AND DD.DAY_NUMBER = 16
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND FIND_IN_SET(DD.DAY_NAME, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0;  -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS uses day names
```

### Explanation:

1. **Selecting Columns**: We're selecting relevant flight details, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, etc.

2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get details of the departure and arrival airports.
   - The `DATE_DAY` table is joined to filter by the specific date.

3. **Filtering Cities**: 
   - Subqueries are used to find the `CITY_CODE` for 'KANSAS CITY' and 'CHICAGO'.

4. **Checking Flight Days**: 
   - The query checks if the day (e.g., Saturday, Sunday) of June 16 is part of the `FLIGHT_DAYS` using `FIND_IN_SET` which looks for the day name in a comma-separated string (assuming FLIGHT_DAYS is in such a format).

Make sure to adjust the query if your database schema has slight variations, especially regarding how `FLIGHT_DAYS` is structured or any other specific conditions you may have.

To retrieve flights from Chicago to Kansas City on June 17, you'll need to join several tables to get the necessary information. Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    d.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID

WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'CHICAGO'
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = 'KANSAS CITY'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Friday'  -- If June 17 is a Friday, adjust accordingly
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2023-06-17 00:00:00'  -- Replace with the relevant year
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '2023-06-18 00:00:00'; -- Up to the end of June 17
```

### Notes:

1. **CITY_CODE**: The value used for `CITY_CODE` in the `AIRPORT` table might need to be adjusted based on your database. Ensure that 'CHICAGO' and 'KANSAS CITY' correspond to the actual values in your database.

2. **DAY_NAME**: Since the specific day (June 17) needs to be determined based on the year, it’s important to confirm which day of the week June 17 falls on, as the `DAYS` table might have values like 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc. The example above assumes June 17 is a Friday; adjust if it falls on another day.

3. **FLIGHT_ID** and **FLIGHT_DAYS**: Make sure that you're correctly filtering based on the `FLIGHT_DAYS`. The `DAY_CODE` for the desired date must match up with the flights.

4. **Adjust Time**: The query filters the flights for June 17, 2023. Extract the correct year from your requirements if different.

This SQL uses standard joins to link relevant tables together and outputs the flight details from Chicago to Kansas City. Adjust according to your data and requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the flights from Kansas City to Chicago on June 16, you can use a SQL query that joins the relevant tables based on the provided schema. The `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT` tables are essential for this query to determine the departure and arrival airports. Assuming you'll be searching for flights for a specific date, you'll also need the `DATE_DAY` table to filter results to the specified day.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql

```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects relevant columns such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME`.
   
2. **Joins**:  
   - **FLIGHT** table is joined with the **AIRPORT** table to get the departure and arrival airports.
   - Then it connects the **CITY** table for both departure (Kansas City) and arrival (Chicago).
   - Additionally, it joins the **DATE_DAY** table to filter results specifically for June 16, 2023.

3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters out the flights based on the city names provided.

### Note:
- Ensure that the year in the query reflects the year you desire. If you generally want just June 16 of any year, you can ignore the year condition or adjust as necessary.
- The subquery in the joins involving `FROM AIRPORT` and `TO AIRPORT` might require adjustment based on actual foreign key relationships, as the tables' relationship isn't explicitly defined in the schema provided. This may need additional tweaking based on real data structure.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all the flights from Chicago to Kansas City on June 17, you can use the following SQL query assuming that the flight information is properly linked through various tables including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `DATE_DAY`. Here’s a sample SQL statement you can utilize:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    M.MONTH_NAME,
    D.DAY_NAME,
    D.YEAR

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve available flights from Kansas City to Chicago for next Wednesday, you will need to conduct a query that identifies the relevant airports, retrieves flights between those airports on the specified day, and includes necessary joins with other tables if you want more details (like fares, aircraft information, etc.).

Below is an SQL query that demonstrates how to find available flights from Kansas City to Chicago for next Wednesday. It's assumed that:
- `KANSAS CITY` refers to a specific city code (you'll need to replace 'KANSAS_CITY_CODE' with the actual city code for Kansas City).
- `CHICAGO` refers to a specific city code (you'll need to replace 'CHICAGO_CODE' with the actual city code for Chicago).
- Assume the relevant information about day mappings, i.e., which day is next Wednesday.

```sql
-- Determine the city codes for Kansas City and Chicago
DECLARE @kansasCityCode VARCHAR(10) = 'KANSAS_CITY_CODE'; -- replace with actual code
DECLARE @chicagoCode VARCHAR(10) = 'CHICAGO_CODE'; -- replace with actual code
DECLARE @nextWednesday DATE = DATEADD(DAY, (7 - DATEPART(WEEKDAY, GETDATE()) + 3) % 7, GETDATE());

-- Find matching flights
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fc.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fc ON ff.FARE_ID = fc.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = @kansasCityCode 
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = @chicagoCode
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%' + (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @nextWednesday)) + '%'
    AND CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DATE) = @nextWednesday
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **City Codes**: Replace `KANSAS_CITY_CODE` and `CHICAGO_CODE` with actual city codes.
2. **Date Calculation**: Calculate next Wednesday's date based on the current date.
3. **Flight Selection**: The main query selects flights, joining `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to get relevant details such as flight numbers, departure and arrival times, and fare costs.
4. **Conditions**:
   - Filter by the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) as Kansas City and destination airport (`TO_AIRPORT`) as Chicago.
   - Ensure the `FLIGHT_DAYS` includes Wednesday's code.
   - Check that the flight's departure date is equal to the calculated date for next Wednesday.

### Note:
- Be mindful of data types and formats in the actual database for functions like `CAST`.
- This query may need adjustments based on how the actual column types or naming conventions are structured in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Phoenix to Detroit on a Monday, you would typically need to join multiple tables from the provided database schema. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this, assuming that the city codes for Phoenix and Detroit are known (let's assume they are 'PHX' for Phoenix and 'DTW' for Detroit):

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    fl.ARICRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE,
    ac.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    ac.MANUFACTURER,
    ac.CRUISING_SPEED,
    ac.RANGE_MILES
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE es ON fl.LEG_FLIGHT = es.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN
    AIRCRAFT ac ON es.AIRCRAFT_CODE = ac.AIRCRAFT_CODE
JOIN
    FLIGHT_DAYS fd ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fd.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    DAYS d ON fd.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'PHOENIX' AND
    a2.CITY_CODE = 'DETROIT' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY';
```

Note:
1. The exact `CITY_CODE` values for Phoenix and Detroit would need to be verified from the CITY table.
2. The JOIN conditions, especially for days, assume that the daily flight schedule is stored in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` table or another table that signifies the days flights are available (this might require additional schema details). Adjust the query as necessary based on actual table relationships.
3. Depending on your database design, some tables such as `FLIGHT_DAYS` may not exist or may be represented differently—adjust the query accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Detroit to San Diego on a Tuesday, you'll need to join several tables, including the **FLIGHT**, **AIRPORT**, **CITY**, and **DAYS** tables. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT A WHERE A.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT A WHERE A.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(D.DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'DETROIT' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO' 
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday';
```

### Explanation:

1. **Select fields**: The query selects relevant fields from the `FLIGHT` table as well as the names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **Joins**: We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get airport names for both departure and arrival. The `CITY` table is joined to ensure that we are filtering flights correctly based on the city names.
3. **Filter conditions**: We filter the results to ensure we are only finding flights that depart from 'DETROIT' and arrive in 'SAN DIEGO' on a Tuesday.

Make sure you adapt field references according to your actual database structure if they differ from the schema provided!

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Cincinnati to San Jose on a Monday, you would need to join several tables in the database schema to retrieve the required flight information. Here's how you could structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fl.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    from_airport.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI')
    AND to_airport.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN JOSE')
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Monday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, such as flight number, times, airline name, and airport names.

2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which holds the necessary flight information.

3. **JOINs**:
   - Join the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name.
   - Join the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport).
   - Join the `FLIGHT_LEG` table to link flights with their respective days of operation.
   - Join the `DAYS` table to filter for Monday.

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters flights that depart from Cincinnati and arrive at San Jose by checking city codes.
   - Ensures that the day of the flight is Monday.

Make sure to modify the query as necessary based on actual data formats or any additional requirement that may arise.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from San Jose to Houston on a Wednesday, we need to join the relevant tables based on the schema provided. We will check for the departure airport (San Jose), the arrival airport (Houston), and ensure the flight day is a Wednesday.

Here's a basic SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    FLIGHT_DAYS fd ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = fd.DAYS_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fd.DAYS_CODE = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'SJC' AND  -- San Jose airport code
    a2.CITY_CODE = 'IAH' AND  -- Houston airport code
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table contains details about flights including their departure and arrival airports.
- The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice to get the names of the departure (San Jose) and arrival (Houston) airports.
- The `FLIGHT_DAYS` and `DAYS` tables are used to filter flights that operate specifically on Wednesdays.
- The WHERE clause filters for the San Jose and Houston airport codes, and specifies that the day must be Wednesday.

Make sure to replace `'SJC'` and `'IAH'` with the actual airport codes for San Jose and Houston based on your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Houston to Memphis on Friday, you will need to join the appropriate tables from the provided schema. Specifically, you will need to join the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables, and filter for the specific departure and destination cities as well as the days of the week.

Here is a SQL query that captures this requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT

WHERE 
    CITY_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'HOUSTON'
    AND CITY_TO.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS'
    AND DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'FRIDAY';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT clause**: Choosing the columns that provide relevant information about the flight.
2. **FROM and JOIN clauses**: Joining `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` (twice) to get the departure and arrival airports, then joining with `CITY` to filter by the city names.
3. **WHERE clause**: Specifying conditions to find flights specifically from Houston to Memphis on Friday. 

Make sure the city names match the ones exactly as they are listed in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Memphis to Cincinnati on Sunday, you would need to join several tables to gather the necessary flight information based on your schema. Assuming we have the necessary data for airports in Memphis and Cincinnati, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'CINCINNATI' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT clause**: We select flight information such as the flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, as well as the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- **FROM clause**: We start from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains information about each flight.
- **JOIN clauses**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports, and join the `DAYS` table to filter flights based on the day of the week.
- **WHERE clause**: We filter for flights departing from MEMPHIS to CINCINNATI where the day is Sunday.

Make sure to check the actual airport codes for MEMPHIS and CINCINNATI to use in place of the respective location strings if needed.

Question: are there any flights on 6 10 from BURBANK to TACOMA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there are any flights from Burbank (BUR) to Tacoma on June 10, we first need to join several tables in your database schema. We will primarily use the `FLIGHT` table to identify flights and filter them by the departure and arrival airports. We also need to consider the `DAYS` and `DATE_DAY` tables to assess the specific date.

Here's how you could construct the SQL query to check for flights from Burbank to Tacoma on June 10:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.AIRLINE_CODE, f.DEPARTURE_TIME, f.ARRIVAL_TIME, f.STOPS 
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DATE_DAY d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAY_NAME
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR' -- Burbank Airport
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = 'TAC' -- Tacoma Airport (assuming TAC is the airport code)
    AND d.MONTH_NUMBER = 6 -- June
    AND d.DAY_NUMBER = 10; -- 10th day of the month
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - `FLIGHT`: To get details about the flights, including flight number, airline code, and times.
   - `AIRPORT`: To map airport codes to their descriptions.
   - `DATE_DAY`: To check that the flight corresponds to June 10.

2. **Joins**:
   - Join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to match the from and to airport codes (Burbank and Tacoma).
   - Join with `DATE_DAY` to filter by the desired date of June 10.

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filter by the airport codes ('BUR' and 'TAC'), month (6 for June), and day (10).

Make sure that you have the correct code for Tacoma's airport in the condition, as it might vary based on your specific dataset.

Raw LLM Response:
To find information on flights from Washington to Boston that leave on a Saturday, you'll need to join multiple tables from your database schema to get the necessary information about flights, airports, and days. 

Here’s an example SQL query that retrieves the relevant data:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAY fd ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = fd.DAYS_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON fd.DAYS_CODE = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON')
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: Specify the columns you want to see in the result, such as flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and stops.
2. **JOIN**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to obtain the names of the departure and destination airports. It also joins with the `FLIGHT_DAY` and `DAYS` to filter for flights on Saturdays.
3. **WHERE**: Filter the results for flights originating from Washington (matching against the `CITY` table) and going to Boston, as well as ensuring that the flight day corresponds to Saturday.

Make sure to adjust table names and columns if they differ in your actual implementation or if the schema has minor discrepancies.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Washington to Montreal on a Saturday from the provided database schema, you'll need to join several tables to get relevant information. Assuming 'WASHINGTON' and 'MONTREAL' are represented in the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables, the query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME

WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON'
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY';
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to filter for flights departing from Washington and arriving in Montreal.
- It also joins the `DAYS` table to narrow down the results to only those flights that operate on Saturdays (`D.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY'`).
- The `FIND_IN_SET` function is used to check if 'SATURDAY' is one of the days listed in `FLIGHT_DAYS`.
- You can modify the select statement to include any additional columns you might need, such as departure and arrival times or airline code.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight options from Boston to Washington on a Saturday, you can construct an SQL query that joins relevant tables from the database schema you have provided. Here's a sample SQL query that pulls necessary flight details for your journey.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    flg.STOPS,
    flg.CONNECTIONS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG flg ON f.FLIGHT_ID = flg.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We select the relevant columns we want to display, which include flight details and airport names.
- **FROM**: The base table is `FLIGHT`, which contains the flight information.
- **JOIN**: We join with `AIRPORT` tables to get the departure and arrival airport names and thus inner join on flight fare and flight leg to get respective costs and leg details.
- **WHERE**: We filter the results to match flights originating from Boston to Washington on Saturdays.

### Assumptions:
- "BOSTON" and "WASHINGTON" refer to the correct airport names or codes within the AIRPORT table. If you need to specify exact airport codes, replace them with appropriate airport codes.
- The `DAYS` table contains a mapping that links to days of the week. Ensure that "SATURDAY" corresponds correctly to the `DAY_NAME` in the DAYS table.
- Depending on the exact structure of the schema and data, you might need to adjust table names, field names, or additional filters.

Make sure to test the query and tweak it as necessary based on your specific requirements and database setup.

Question: list SATURDAY flights from WASHINGTON to BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "SATURDAY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list Saturday flights from Washington to Boston using the provided database schema, you will need to retrieve information from multiple tables. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that by joining the necessary tables:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON fare.RESTRICTION_CODE = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BOSTON' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the fields to retrieve, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which contains the flight information.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Joins `AIRPORT` twice to get the names of the departure (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and arrival (`TO_AIRPORT`) airports.
   - Joins `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to link flights with fare restrictions.
   - Joins `RESTRICTION` to filter based on the requirement that we are only interested in flights that have a SATURDAY condition.
   - Joins `DAYS` to ensure the correct day of the week for flights.

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights from "WASHINGTON" to "BOSTON" on Saturdays.

### Note:
Please replace the `'WASHINGTON'` and `'BOSTON'` with the respective airport codes or names from the `CITY` or `AIRPORT` tables based on your database's structure, as airport locations may need to be verified specifically in that context.

Raw LLM Response:
To list Saturday flights from Boston to Washington, you need to join several tables to filter flights based on the departure city (Boston), destination city (Washington), the day of the week (Saturday), and flight information. Here is a sample SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    d.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_from ON a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = c_to.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY dd ON dd.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'  -- Assuming you have a way to relate the flight days to calendar days
WHERE 
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    AND c_to.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON';
```

Make sure to adjust the relationships according to your actual data. Here's a breakdown of the query:

- **FLIGHT** is joined with **AIRPORT** for both the departure and arrival to filter by cities.
- **CITY** is used to identify the source and destination based on city names.
- The **DATE_DAY** table is assumed to contain the mapping for the days of the week to filter only Saturday flights.
- `WHERE` clause restricts the results to flights specifically between Boston and Washington on Saturday.

Note that the exact schema may require you to adjust the joins depending on how your tables are structured regarding mapping cities, airports, and days. If there’s a specific way days are related to flights (e.g., via the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column or another table), you will need to make further adjustments to incorporate those relationships accurately.

Question: what flights go from DALLAS to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights going from Dallas to Phoenix, you'll need to join relevant tables and filter the results based on the departure and arrival airports. Assuming you have the airport codes for Dallas and Phoenix, which are typically "DFW" (Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport) and "PHX" (Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DALLAS%'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%PHOENIX%';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns that you want to retrieve, including flight details and airport names.
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table as the main table because it contains flight information.
3. **JOINs**: 
   - Join the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Dallas) and once for the arrival airport (Phoenix).
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from Dallas and arriving in Phoenix. Adjust the airport conditions as needed based on the exact airport names or codes.

Make sure to adjust the airport codes/names in the query if they are different in your database.

Question: what flights go from PHOENIX to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Phoenix to Salt Lake City, you would typically want to join tables to get the desired results, including the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and connecting the airports to their respective cities. Given that we look specifically for flights, here's a SQL query that might help you achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX' AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **FLIGHT F**: The primary table containing flight details.
- **JOIN AIRPORT A1**: Join to get the airport information for the departure airport.
- **JOIN AIRPORT A2**: Join to get the airport information for the arrival airport.
- **JOIN CITY C1 & C2**: Joining the city tables to filter flights based on the city names.
- **WHERE**: The condition to filter flights specifically from Phoenix to Salt Lake City.

This will return the flight number, departure time, arrival time, and the names of the departure and arrival airports for all flights that meet the criteria.

Question: flights from WASHINGTON to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Washington to Seattle, you need to consider the airports in Washington that serve Seattle's airport. Assuming Seattle has an airport code (for example, "SEA" for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport), you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the airports in Washington.
2. Join the `FLIGHT` table to find the flights available from those airports to Seattle.

Here's a possible SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    A.STATE_CODE = 'WA'  -- Washington state code
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'; -- Seattle airport code (adjust as necessary)
```

Make sure to replace 'SEA' with the correct airport code for Seattle if it's different. Additionally, ensure that 'WA' is the correct state code for Washington; you can verify it using the `STATE` table if needed.

Question: flights from ATLANTA to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Atlanta to Seattle using the database schema provided, you would typically want to join several tables to get details about the flights, including the flight number, departure and arrival times, the airline, and possibly other details related to aircraft and fare. 

Here is an SQL query that could be used to fetch those flight details:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    L.AIRLINE_NAME,
    E.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE L ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = L.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT E ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = E.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Seattle-Tacoma International Airport';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selection of Columns**: We select relevant columns such as flight ID, flight number, the names of the from and to airports, departure and arrival times, airline name, aircraft description, number of stops, and time elapsed.

2. **Joins**:
    - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline information.
    - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Atlanta) and once for the arrival airport (Seattle).
    - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table to retrieve details about the aircraft used.

3. **Where Clause**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights that depart from Atlanta (Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and arrive in Seattle (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport).

Make sure to confirm the exact airport names in your database since they need to match the entries in the `AIRPORT` table. Adjust the airport names in the query accordingly if they differ.

Question: flights from SAN DIEGO to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from San Diego to Seattle using the provided database schema, you would typically need to join the relevant tables to filter flights based on the specified departure and arrival cities. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    al.AIRLINE_NAME,
    fl.CONNECTIONS,
    fl.STOPS,
    ff.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Diego' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Seattle';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight details such as the flight number, departure and arrival times, the names of the departure and arrival airports, the airline name, and any associated fare costs.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (San Diego) and once for the arrival airport (Seattle).
- The `AIRLINE` table is joined to get the airline name, and the `FLIGHT_FARE` table is joined to retrieve fare information.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only those flights that depart from San Diego and arrive in Seattle.

Make sure to adjust airport name checks (`a1.AIRPORT_NAME` and `a2.AIRPORT_NAME`) based on how they are stored in the database, as the airport codes or other identifying information may need to be used instead of names in some implementations. You may also want to include further criteria based on your requirements (such as filtering by date).

Question: i would like flight information from PHOENIX to DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Phoenix to Denver, you would typically join several tables to gather the necessary information such as flight details, departure and arrival airports, and possibly the associated fares. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHOENIX'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns, including flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and other pertinent flight details.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Phoenix) and once for the arrival airport (Denver).
- The `WHERE` clause filters based on the departure airport being in Phoenix and the arrival airport being in Denver.

### Note:
You may need to adjust the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` field depending on how the data is stored in your `AIRPORT` table. If you have specific airport codes (e.g., PHX for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and DEN for Denver International Airport), you can use the airport codes in the WHERE clause instead. Here's an example using specific codes:

```sql
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN';
``` 

Ensure that your actual database scheme allows for these columns and relationships as described.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights from Salt Lake City to Phoenix, you will need to join several tables using appropriate conditions. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this by joining the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables. Please ensure to replace the placeholder fields with actual values if necessary. 

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,

    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT as1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE as1 WHERE as1.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT as2.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE as2 WHERE as2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE)
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX';
```

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves flight information such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, number of connections, stops, and time elapsed.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the departure and arrival airport names.
- The `CITY` table is joined to identify the airports corresponding to Salt Lake City and Phoenix.
- The necessary conditions are set in the `WHERE` clause to filter flights specifically from Salt Lake City to Phoenix. 

Make sure your database engine supports subqueries in the `JOIN` clause as used above. If not, you will need to find the respective airport codes for Salt Lake City and Phoenix beforehand and use them directly in your SQL query.

Question: could i have flight information on flights from PITTSBURGH to PHOENIX please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights from Pittsburgh to Phoenix, you'll need to join the relevant tables based on the provided schema. The main tables involved would be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` or other related tables depending on the specific details you want to include (like fare information).

Here is a SQL query that retrieves basic flight information from Pittsburgh to Phoenix:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%PITTSBURGH%' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%PHOENIX%';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the departure airport (Pittsburgh) and once for the arrival airport (Phoenix).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the records to find only those flights that depart from an airport in Pittsburgh and arrive at an airport in Phoenix.
- The selected columns include the necessary flight details such as flight number, airline code, airport names, departure and arrival times, stops, elapsed time, and connections.

Make sure to adjust the conditions in the `WHERE` clause if you have specific airport codes for the Pittsburgh and Phoenix airports (e.g., PIT for Pittsburgh International Airport and PHX for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport). This will speed up the query and ensure accuracy. Here's how it would look:

```sql
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIT' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX';
```
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,

Question: list flights from MILWAUKEE to DETROIT
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Milwaukee to Detroit, we need to join the relevant tables to extract the necessary information. Assuming "MILWAUKEE" and "DETROIT" refer to the cities and that we need to find the appropriate airport codes for those cities, we can proceed as follows:

1. Identify the airport codes for Milwaukee and Detroit.
2. Retrieve the flights between the corresponding airport codes.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = AC.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = AC.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'DETROIT';
```

### Explanation of the query:
- We are selecting data from the `FLIGHT` table to get flight-related information.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the destination airport) to get the airport names.
- We join the `CITY` table to filter the flights specifically for Milwaukee (C1) and Detroit (C2).
- The `WHERE` clause specifies the origin and destination cities.

Make sure that `CITY_CODE` in the `AIRPORT` table corresponds accurately with the `CITY` table. This SQL assumes that the necessary relationships between the tables are set up properly. Adjust the query if the database design requires more specific join conditions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Detroit to Toronto, you may want to access the appropriate tables that can help you filter the flights based on the departure airport (Detroit) and the arrival airport (Toronto). The following SQL query assumes the use of airport codes for filtering.

Here's the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.CONNECTIONS,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Detroit' AND 
    TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Toronto';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Statement**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the flight information including the airline code, flight number, departure, and arrival times, among others.
2. **Join Operation**: Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to filter flights departing from Detroit and arriving at Toronto.
3. **Condition Clause**: Filters results by matching the airport names to 'Detroit' and 'Toronto'.

Make sure that the airport names are accurate according to your database records. If you're using airport codes instead, you should modify the WHERE clause accordingly to use the airport codes (e.g., `FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DTW'` for Detroit and `TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'YYZ'` for Toronto).

Question: get flights from TORONTO to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Toronto to Milwaukee, you'll typically need to join several tables to get the necessary information. The key tables would be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly other tables for additional details such as `FLIGHT_FARE` if you want to include fare information.

Assuming you're primarily interested in basic flight details, here is a sample SQL query to get flights from Toronto to Milwaukee:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Toronto' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: Choosing the specific columns we want to see in the result.
2. **FROM FLIGHT f**: Using the `FLIGHT` table with an alias `f`.
3. **JOIN AIRPORT a_from**: Joining with the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the departure airport (Toronto).
4. **JOIN AIRPORT a_to**: Joining again with the `AIRPORT` table for the arrival airport (Milwaukee).
5. **WHERE**: Filtering the results to flights that depart from Toronto and arrive in Milwaukee.

Make sure that the names used in the `WHERE` clause for the airports match the actual values in the `AIRPORT` table, as airport names may differ slightly or have differing terminologies (for instance, a common abbreviation may be used). If your `AIRPORT` table includes airport codes (e.g., "YYZ" for Toronto Pearson International Airport and "MKE" for General Mitchell International Airport), you may use airport codes instead of names for more accuracy.

### Note:
If you need more detail (like fares, connections, airlines, etc.), you would extend the query to include additional tables in a similar manner, depending on the information you require.

Question: get flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights between St. Petersburg and Charlotte from the database schema provided, you need to join several tables to find flights based on the departure airport in St. Petersburg and the arrival airport in Charlotte. Below is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PETERSBURG' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, time elapsed, and names of the airports involved in the flights.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice — once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
- The `CITY` table is also joined twice to ensure that we filter the flights based on the city names "ST. PETERSBURG" and "CHARLOTTE."
- The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include flights departing from St. Petersburg and arriving in Charlotte.

Question: list flights from LAS VEGAS to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Las Vegas (LAS) to Phoenix (PHX), you can join relevant tables in the database schema. Given that you need flight information, you'll likely want to include data from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, and possibly `AIRPORT` tables. Here is an example SQL query that retrieves flights from Las Vegas to Phoenix:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_FROM AF ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AF.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_TO AT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    AF.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LAS' AND 
    AT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: Choose the columns you want to display in the results, such as flight ID, airline code, flight number, departure and arrival times, and other relevant flight details.
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Selects data from the `FLIGHT` table, using the alias `F`.
- `JOIN`: This statement is used to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` and `AIRLINE` tables.
    - `JOIN AIRPORT_FROM AF ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AF.AIRPORT_CODE`: Where `AF` is an alias created for the `AIRPORT` table to get the source airport code (Las Vegas).
    - `JOIN AIRPORT_TO AT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AT.AIRPORT_CODE`: Where `AT` is another alias for the `AIRPORT` table for the destination airport code (Phoenix).
- `WHERE`: Filters the results to include only those flights that depart from Las Vegas (LAS) and arrive in Phoenix (PHX).

Make sure to adjust the query based on the exact column names and requirements specified in your database schema.

Question: what are the flights from CLEVELAND to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Cleveland to Dallas using the provided database schema, you need to join multiple tables, especially the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. You also need to identify the airport codes for Cleveland and Dallas from the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables.

Here's how your SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    AP_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AP_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = AC_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN

WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT F**: This table includes all the flight details.
- **AIRPORT AP_FROM and AP_TO**: These table aliases help you identify the departure and destination airports.
- **CITY C_FROM and C_TO**: You join this table to filter the results based on the city names.
- **WHERE clause**: This part filters the results to only include flights departing from Cleveland and arriving in Dallas.

Make sure you adjust any table names with a requirement fit for your database, such as aliases used based on your exact database schema.

Question: i need information on flights from INDIANAPOLIS to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about flights from Indianapolis to Seattle using the provided database schema, you'll need to join several tables to get the relevant details like flight number, departure and arrival times, airlines, etc. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'INDIANAPOLIS'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SEATTLE';
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT f**: This table contains details about the flights, including flight number and the corresponding airline codes.
- **AIRPORT a1 and a2**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to differentiate between the departure airport (Indianapolis) and the destination airport (Seattle).
- **AIRLINE a**: To get the airline name associated with each flight.
- **FARE fare**: This is joined to fetch the costs for the flights.
- **WHERE clause**: Specifies that we're looking for flights departing from Indianapolis and arriving in Seattle. 

### Note:
- The query assumes that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` column in the `AIRPORT` table directly stores city names, which may not be explicitly indicated in the schema. If the database structure is different, you may need to join with the `CITY` table to obtain city codes for Indianapolis and Seattle before using them in this query.

```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: We are selecting flight ID, airline flight number, departure and arrival airports, times, elapsed time, number of stops, meal code, one-way cost, and round-trip cost.
- **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `f`).
- **JOINs**:
  - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get names of the departure and arrival airports.
  - We further join the `CITY` table to filter our results based on the city names 'MEMPHIS' and 'SEATTLE'.
  - Then we join on the `FARE` table to obtain the fare information related to the flight.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters for flights specifically from Memphis to Seattle.

You may need to adjust the query based on your actual data or requirements in terms of output, such as adding more filters or ordering the results.

Question: i need flight information from MILWAUKEE to TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Milwaukee to Tampa, we will assume that we need to make joins across multiple tables to get the desired information, including flight details, fare, and related data.

Here's an SQL query that may help you retrieve relevant flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DUAL_CARRIER,
    FF.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FF.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    R.RESTRICTION_CODE,
    R.ADVANCE_PURCHASE,
    R.STOPOVERS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FARE ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION R ON FARE.RESTRICTION_CODE = R.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee')
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'Tampa');
```

This SQL query does the following:
- It selects various fields from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `RESTRICTION` tables.
- It joins these tables on their respective keys to gather comprehensive flight information.
- It filters the results to include only flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Tampa by using subqueries to find the corresponding airport codes for these cities.

Before executing this query, ensure that the names of the airports ('Milwaukee' and 'Tampa') perfectly match what is stored in your `AIRPORT` table. Adjust the query accordingly if the airport names differ. Additionally, you might want to format date and time outputs based on your specific requirements.

Question: i need flights departing from OAKLAND and arriving SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that depart from Oakland and arrive in Salt Lake City, you'll need to use the `FLIGHT` table to get the relevant flight information such as departure and arrival airports, along with city information from the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables. Here’s an SQL query that joins the necessary tables and filters the results accordingly:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    c_from.CITY_NAME AS DEPARTURE_CITY,
    c_to.CITY_NAME AS ARRIVAL_CITY
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_from ON a_from.CITY_CODE = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_to ON a_to.CITY_CODE = c_to.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'Oakland' 
    AND c_to.CITY_NAME = 'Salt Lake City';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be returned in the output (flight details and related airport and city names).
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Starting with the `FLIGHT` table as the primary table (`f` is an alias for easier reference).
- **JOIN**: Joining `AIRPORT` tables for departure and arrival to get their respective names and joining `CITY` tables to filter by city name.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from 'Oakland' and arriving in 'Salt Lake City'.

Note: Always ensure the names in the filter condition match exactly the names in your database (case-sensitive), and make sure the `CITY` table contains the correct city names for the given conditions. Adjust the condition if the city names are stored differently.

Question: i need information on flights from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights from Toronto to San Diego, you will typically need to join several tables to acquire the relevant details about the flights, such as flight numbers, times, and the airlines operating them. The following SQL query can be used to obtain this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.MEAL_CODE,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fl.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a1 ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a1.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = ap1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ap2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = ap2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fl.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    ap1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Toronto' AND ap2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Diego';
```

### Explanation of the Query
- **SELECT Clause**: Here we select the fields we want to retrieve, including flight details such as `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and fare details.
  
- **FROM Clause**: We start from the `FLIGHT` table to get flight-related entries.
  
- **JOIN Clauses**: 
  - We join the `AIRLINE` table to get information about the airline that operates the flight.
  - We join the `AIRPORT` table to get details about the departure and arrival airports.
  - We join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve fare information associated with each flight.

- **WHERE Clause**: We filter for flights specifically departing from Toronto and arriving in San Diego.

### Note
- Ensure that the airport names (e.g., 'Toronto' and 'San Diego') correctly match those used in your `AIRPORT` table. You may need to adjust the airport names depending on how they are stored (e.g., if specific airport codes or complete names are used).
- This query assumes that the detail of Toronto and San Diego can be directly referenced by their names. You might need further refinement based on how your `AIRPORT` table is populated. You may also need to consider whether multiple airports operate within those cities and adjust your query based on unique `AIRPORT_CODE`s.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights from Toronto to San Diego, you need to join multiple tables in the database schema. Assuming that "Toronto" corresponds to the airport code "YYZ" (Toronto Pearson International Airport) and "San Diego" corresponds to the airport code "SAN" (San Diego International Airport), the following SQL query can be used:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    FL.FLIGHT_ID,
    FL.LEG_NUMBER,
    FL.LEG_FLIGHT,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YYZ' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN';
```

This query selects the flight number, airline code, airline name, departure and arrival times, number of stops, time elapsed, meal code, flight ID, leg number, leg flight, and connections for all flights traveling from Toronto to San Diego. 

Make sure to replace 'YYZ' and 'SAN' with the appropriate airport codes if they are different in your database.

Question: i want a flight from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Toronto to San Diego, we will need to join several tables from your database schema. Specifically, we will primarily focus on the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to include fare information.

Here’s an example SQL query to find flights from Toronto to San Diego along with relevant details:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'TORONTO' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'SAN DIEGO';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting flight numbers, airline codes, departure and arrival airport names, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and total time elapsed.
- We use a `JOIN` to connect the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to retrieve the names of the departure and arrival airports based on their respective airport codes.
- We filter the results using a `WHERE` clause to specify that the departure airport is located in Toronto, and the arrival airport is in San Diego.

### Note:
- Make sure that 'TORONTO' and 'SAN DIEGO' are represented properly in your `AIRPORT` table (e.g., using their actual airport codes).
- This is a basic query. Depending on requirements, you might want to include fare details, flight schedules, or additional filters (like specific airline codes or time frames).

Question: i need information on flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on flights between St. Petersburg and Charlotte, you can use a SQL query that joins relevant tables based on the available schema. We will join the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables to obtain the necessary information about the flights, as well as the corresponding airports.

First, we need to identify the airport codes for St. Petersburg and Charlotte. Assuming you know the airport codes or want to find them first, we can start by querying the `AIRPORT` table. Once we have the airport codes, we can then construct a query to find flights.

Here's an example SQL query that retrieves flight information between St. Petersburg (assuming its airport code is `PIE`) and Charlotte (assuming its airport code is `CLT`):

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify the airport codes for St. Petersburg and Charlotte
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_NAME IN ('ST. PETERSBURG', 'CHARLOTTE');

-- Step 2: Retrieve flight information using the identified airport codes
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PIE' AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'CLT';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: The first query selects the airport codes for St. Petersburg and Charlotte. Replace `ST. PETERSBURG` and `CHARLOTTE` with the actual names if necessary.
2. **Step 2**: The second query retrieves flight information by:
    - Selecting relevant flight details like flight number, airline code, departure/arrival times, number of stops, and connections.
    - Joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get names for both the departure and arrival airports.
    - Filtering flights to only include those from St. Petersburg (`PIE`) to Charlotte (`CLT`).

Make sure to replace the assumed airport codes `PIE` and `CLT` with the actual codes if they differ. If you run this in a database with the given schema, it will provide the desired flight information.

Question: i need the flight numbers of flights leaving from CLEVELAND and arriving at DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CLEVELAND" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers of flights leaving from Cleveland and arriving in Dallas, you need to join the appropriate tables that hold information about airports and flights. First, you need to identify the airport codes for both Cleveland and Dallas. Then, you will filter flights based on these airport codes.

Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND'
  AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

In this query:
- We select the flight numbers (`FLIGHT_NUMBER`) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get information about the departure airport (Cleveland) and once for the arrival airport (Dallas).
- We filter the results with a `WHERE` clause to match the airport names for Cleveland and Dallas.

Make sure to replace `AIRPORT_NAME` with the actual names or check that the names used in the condition match the names stored in your `AIRPORT` table. If the actual airport names contain city details (like "Cleveland Hopkins International Airport"), you may need to adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly.

Question: show me flights from MILWAUKEE to ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from Milwaukee to Orlando using the given database schema, you would typically need to join several tables, particularly the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially the `FLIGHT_FARE` or other related tables for additional information if needed. Below is a basic SQL query that retrieves relevant flight information for flights departing from Milwaukee to Orlando.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE') AND
    a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO');
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- **SELECT Clause**: This part selects various fields that might be of interest such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, stops, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- **FROM Clause**: This specifies the main table `FLIGHT` from which we want to retrieve the data.
- **JOIN Clauses**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports based on their airport codes.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the flights to include only those that depart from Milwaukee and arrive in Orlando by checking city names in the `CITY` table.

Make sure to adjust the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables based on how your data is organized, particularly if city codes are determined by methods other than the CITY_NAME field. Additionally, running this query will depend on the actual data and existing connections in your database.

Question: show me all flights from ORLANDO to MONTREAL please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Orlando to Montreal, you would first need to obtain the relevant airport codes for both locations. Assuming, for example, that the airport codes for Orlando and Montreal are "MCO" and "YUL" respectively, you could write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.DUAL_CARRIER
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MONTREAL';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table (`FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, etc.).
- We're joining the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Orlando) and once for the arrival airport (Montreal).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights where the departure airport is Orlando and the destination airport is Montreal.

Please replace 'ORLANDO' and 'MONTREAL' with the actual airport names or associations based on your existing `AIRPORT` table data, as needed.

Question: show me the flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Indianapolis to Memphis using the provided database schema, you'll need to join the relevant tables together to get complete information about the flights, including their details, departure and arrival airports, and relevant airline information. Here's a sample SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = cs1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = cs2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'Indianapolis' 
    AND c1.STATE_CODE = (SELECT STATE_CODE FROM STATE WHERE STATE_NAME = 'Indiana')
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'Memphis' 
    AND c2.STATE_CODE = (SELECT STATE_CODE FROM STATE WHERE STATE_NAME = 'Tennessee');
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airport names, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and total time elapsed.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice to match the departure airport (Indianapolis) and the arrival airport (Memphis).
   - The `CITY` table is also joined to ensure that you're referencing the correct city names and state codes.
3. **WHERE Clause**: The conditions ensure that the flights are from Indianapolis (Indiana) to Memphis (Tennessee).

Please adjust the query as needed based on your database environment or any specific requirements!

Question: ST. PETERSBURG to DETROIT
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from St. Petersburg to Detroit, we would need to query multiple tables in our database schema. Here's a basic SQL query that could achieve this. This query assumes that St. Petersburg and Detroit are represented by their city codes in the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables, and retrieves relevant flight details:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    A.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT DA ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = DA.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AA ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AA.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY CA ON DA.AIRPORT_CODE = CA.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY CDA ON AA.AIRPORT_CODE = CDA.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    CA.CITY_NAME = 'St. Petersburg' 
    AND CDA.CITY_NAME = 'Detroit';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve, including flight number, airline name, departure time, etc.
- **FROM**: Indicates the main table (`FLIGHT`) from which we are gathering data.
- **JOIN**: Combines several related tables to access additional information about flights and airports.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to include only those flights departing from St. Petersburg and arriving in Detroit.

### Note:
1. Ensure that the actual city names, airport codes, and other relevant identifiers accurately match those in your database.
2. Depending on the actual requirements, you may need to adjust the fields selected or the filters applied based on additional criteria such as layovers, flight days, etc.

Question: show me all flights from SAN JOSE to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from San Jose to Phoenix using the provided database schema, you need to find the respective airport codes for both locations and then query the `FLIGHT` table accordingly. Assuming we have the airport codes for San Jose and Phoenix (let's say SAN for San Jose and PHX for Phoenix), the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.CONNECTIONS, 
    F.STOPS, 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Jose' AND 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Phoenix';
```

This query selects several columns from the `FLIGHT` table and joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights departing from San Jose to Phoenix.

Make sure to replace 'San Jose' and 'Phoenix' with the actual airport names or adjust based on the specific airport codes if needed (for example, using `A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SAN'` and `A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX'` if you want to use airport codes directly).

SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from San Jose to Phoenix, you'll need to first identify the airport codes for both locations based on your database schema. Assuming that you know the airport codes or you want to dynamically retrieve them based on city names, you can utilize a SQL query that joins relevant tables.

Here's an example SQL query to achieve this, while first fetching the airport codes for San Jose and Phoenix from the `AIRPORT` table based on the `CITY` table.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM CITY INNER JOIN AIRPORT ON CITY.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'SAN JOSE')
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM CITY INNER JOIN AIRPORT ON CITY.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION WHERE CITY.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX');
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects relevant flight details from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the source airport information (for San Jose) and once to get the destination airport information (for Phoenix).
- The `WHERE` clause contains subqueries to filter airport codes based on city names for San Jose and Phoenix.
  
Make sure to adjust the schema references if the actual relationships or field names are different in your database.

Question: show me flights from PHOENIX to FORT WORTH
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "FORT WORTH" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Phoenix to Fort Worth, you can use a SQL query that joins relevant tables to get the details. Assuming the airport codes for Phoenix and Fort Worth are known (for example, PHX for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and DFW for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport), the query will look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE.MILES_DISTANT,
    AIRPORT_SERVICE.DIRECTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Phoenix' 
    AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Fort Worth';
```

Ensure to update the conditions in the `WHERE` clause to accurately reflect the airport codes for Phoenix and Fort Worth based on your `AIRPORT` table. If you need more specific details like available fares, you can expand the query further to include those details by joining relevant fare tables.

Question: show me flights from FORT WORTH to SAN JOSE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "FORT WORTH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Fort Worth to San Jose, you will need to gather relevant information from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially the `CITY` tables to ensure you are targeting the correct airports. First, we need to identify the airport codes corresponding to Fort Worth and San Jose. Let's assume the airport codes for Fort Worth is `DFW` (Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport) and for San Jose is `SJC` (San Jose International Airport). 

Here’s an SQL query to show the flights from Fort Worth to San Jose:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_AIRLINE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    f.FLIGHT_DAYS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS,
    f.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DFW'  -- Fort Worth Airport Code
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SJC';  -- San Jose Airport Code
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting various flight details, including flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline, and other relevant flight attributes.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table to get the full names of the departure and arrival airports.
- We filter the results to flights originating from Fort Worth (`DFW`) and arriving at San Jose (`SJC`).

Make sure you have the correct airport codes, as the codes used in the SQL query (`DFW` and `SJC`) are based on common usage and may vary depending on your specific database.

Question: list flights from CHICAGO to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Chicago to San Diego, we need to join several tables to filter the flights based on the departure airport (Chicago) and the arrival airport (San Diego). Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT, 
    A1.CITY_CODE AS DEPARTURE_CITY, 
    A2.CITY_CODE AS ARRIVAL_CITY, 
    A.FARE_ID,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO');
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT F**: This is the main table that contains flight information.
2. **JOIN AIRPORT A1 and A2**: We join the AIRPORT table twice, once for Chicago (departure) and once for San Diego (arrival).
3. **WHERE conditions**: We filter the results to only include flights where:
   - The departure city is Chicago
   - The arrival city is San Diego

This query returns the flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, names of the departure and arrival airports, and the time elapsed for the flights between Chicago and San Diego. Make sure that the CITY and AIRPORT tables contain the appropriate entries for Chicago and San Diego, as this query depends on that data being available.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Chicago to San Diego, you will need to join multiple tables to access all relevant information regarding flights, airports, and their connections. Assuming the airline codes, flight details, and airport details are mapped appropriately, here is an example SQL query that retrieves the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO');
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Chicago) and once for the arrival airport (San Diego).
- Subqueries the `CITY` table to find the `CITY_CODE` for both Chicago and San Diego.
- It selects relevant columns such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `FROM_AIRPORT_NAME`, `TO_AIRPORT_NAME`, along with departure and arrival times, stops, and elapsed time.

Make sure to adapt the query if there are any specific database conventions or if different names for the cities or airports are used in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Kansas City to Denver, you need to join several tables in the database schema that contain relevant information about flights, departure and arrival airports, and their respective city information. Here's an SQL query that retrieves flights from Kansas City (KANSAS CITY airport code) to Denver (DENVER airport code):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'DENVER');
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- `SELECT`: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and names of the departure and arrival airports.
- `FROM FLIGHT F`: Indicates the main table (FLIGHT) that contains flight details.
- `JOIN AIRPORT A1 ...`: Joins the AIRPORT table twice; once to get details for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport.
- `WHERE`: Applies filters to ensure we only get flights departing from Kansas City and arriving in Denver. It uses correlated subqueries to find the CITY_CODE corresponding to each city name.

Make sure to replace `'KANSAS CITY'` and `'DENVER'` with the actual city names or codes as they exist in the CITY table, if they're different.

Question: list flights from DENVER to PHOENIX
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Denver to Phoenix, you would typically need to join several tables in your database schema. You would be particularly interested in the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially filtered on `FLIGHT_FARE` if you want to also include fare information.

Assuming the codes for Denver and Phoenix airports are `DEN` and `PHX` respectively, here’s an example SQL query to retrieve the needed flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX';
```

In this query:
- `f` is an alias for the `FLIGHT` table.
- `a1` is an alias for the `AIRPORT` table corresponding to the departure airport (Denver).
- `a2` is an alias for the `AIRPORT` table corresponding to the arrival airport (Phoenix).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights departing from Denver (DEN) and arriving in Phoenix (PHX).

Make sure to adjust any airport codes as necessary based on the actual data in your `AIRPORT` table.

Question: list flights from PHOENIX to LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Phoenix to Las Vegas using the given database schema, you would typically perform a query on the `FLIGHT` table, filtering for flights that depart from the Phoenix airport and arrive at the Las Vegas airport. You'll need to identify the airport codes for both cities from the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables. 

Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PHOENIX' AND
    A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LAS VEGAS';
```

In this query:
- We select the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, number of stops, connections, and time elapsed.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Phoenix) and once for the arrival airport (Las Vegas).
- We filter the results to only include flights originating from Phoenix and ending in Las Vegas based on their respective `AIRPORT_LOCATION`. 

Make sure to replace `AIRPORT_LOCATION` with the appropriate field if it doesn't exactly match your schema. If you're using `CITY` to filter by city name instead, you would need to get the airport codes for Phoenix and Las Vegas first.

Question: list flights from LAS VEGAS to SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Las Vegas (LAS) to San Diego (SAN), you'll want to query the `FLIGHT` table, filtering on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns. Additionally, you can join other relevant tables to include more information, such as the airline and departure/arrival times. Here’s a basic SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    ac.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    f.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE es ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = es.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT ac ON es.AIRCRAFT_CODE = ac.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS' AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Clause**: This selects the relevant flight information to be displayed, including flight ID, flight number, departure/arrival times, airline name, aircraft description, and the number of stops.

2. **FROM Clause**: The main table being queried is the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `f`).

3. **JOIN Clauses**:
   - It joins the `AIRLINE` table (aliased as `a`) to get the airline names.
   - It joins the `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` table (aliased as `es`) to link each flight with its corresponding aircraft.
   - It joins the `AIRCRAFT` table (aliased as `ac`) to get descriptions of the aircraft.

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights that depart from Las Vegas (LAS) and arrive in San Diego (SAN).

Make sure that the airport codes 'LAS' and 'SAN' exist in your corresponding tables to avoid empty results. Adjust the query as needed to include any additional information or filters, such as specific dates or times.

Question: list flights from HOUSTON to SAN JOSE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Houston to San Jose, you'll need to use a SQL query that joins multiple tables to extract the necessary data. The relevant tables for this query include `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly other related tables like `FLIGHT_FARE` if fare information is required.

Assuming that the airport codes for Houston and San Jose are known (e.g., IAH for George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and SJC for San Jose International Airport), the SQL query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Houston' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'San Jose';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The `SELECT` statement specifies the columns we want to retrieve: flight number, airline code, departure/arrival times, stops, total time elapsed, and the names of the originating and destination airports.
- The `FLIGHT` table is aliased as `f`.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - First, to get details for the departure airport (Houston).
  - Second, to get details for the arrival airport (San Jose).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights departing from Houston and arriving in San Jose.

Ensure to replace `'Houston'` and `'San Jose'` with the exact names or criteria you have in your database if necessary. Also, replace `AIRPORT_CODE` values in the `FLIGHT` table accordingly if you need to search by specific airport codes rather than by airport names.

Question: list flights from HOUSTON to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Houston to Milwaukee, you need to join the relevant tables, including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly others for additional details. Assuming that `HOUSTON` and `MILWAUKEE` correspond to specific airport codes (for example, IAH for George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and MKE for General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee), you can write an SQL query as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'HOUSTON' AND 
    A2.CITY_CODE = 'MILWAUKEE';
```

Note:
- You need to make sure that the `CITY_CODE` values are correct in the `AIRPORT` table for `HOUSTON` and `MILWAUKEE`. 
- Replace the `CITY_CODE` with the appropriate airport codes if needed, or join with a `CITY` table to get the codes if `AIRPORT` table does not contain them directly.
- If you need more specific details about the flights (like meal services, fares, etc.), you can include additional joins as required.

Question: list flights from DALLAS to HOUSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Dallas to Houston based on the provided database schema, you will need to reference the relevant tables, particularly the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to ensure you capture flights that operate between the two cities.

Assuming you have identified the airport codes for Dallas and Houston, you can write a SQL query to retrieve the flight details. Below is a possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DALLAS' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to show only flights that depart from Dallas and arrive in Houston.
- The query retrieves various details about the flights, including flight IDs, flight numbers, airline codes, departure/arrival times, stops, connections, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.

Make sure that the field values for Airport Locations are accurate according to how they are stored in the database. Adjust the filter conditions if the airport codes or names are stored differently in the schema.

Question: list flights from NEW YORK to LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from New York to Los Angeles, you can write an SQL query that retrieves the relevant flight details based on the flight's origin and destination airports. You will need to join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport information. Here’s an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES');
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table (like flight number, airline code, departure/arrival times, etc.).
- `JOIN` is used to link the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (New York) and once for the destination airport (Los Angeles).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights that depart from New York and arrive in Los Angeles based on city codes sourced from the `CITY` table. 

Make sure that the necessary mappings of city names to airport codes through the corresponding tables exist in your database for this query to work effectively.

Question: list flights from LOS ANGELES to ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Los Angeles to Orlando, you would need to join several tables in order to extract the relevant information. Assuming that the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns in the `FLIGHT` table reference the airport codes from the `AIRPORT` table, the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Los Angeles' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando';
```

This SQL query does the following:

1. It selects the relevant columns including flight number, airline code, departure/arrival airports (with their names), departure time, arrival time, time elapsed, number of stops, and connections.
2. It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Los Angeles) and once for the destination airport (Orlando).
3. It filters the results where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is Los Angeles and the `TO_AIRPORT` is Orlando. 

Note: Please ensure that the names 'Los Angeles' and 'Orlando' in the `WHERE` clause match the actual data in your `AIRPORT` table. If you are using airport codes instead, you need to replace these with the corresponding airport codes for Los Angeles and Orlando.

Question: give me the flights from PHOENIX to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee using the given database schema, you would need to identify the airport codes for Phoenix and Milwaukee, and then query the `FLIGHT` table to get relevant flight details. Below is an example SQL query assuming the airport codes for Phoenix and Milwaukee are known (for example, PHX for Phoenix and MKE for Milwaukee). 

Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHOENIX' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is used to get flight information.
- The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice: once for the departure airport (PHOENIX) and once for the arrival airport (MILWAUKEE).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights departing from Phoenix and arriving in Milwaukee.
  
Make sure to replace the airport names with the appropriate codes if your schema uses different identifiers. If you do not know the exact names or if there are multiple airports in each city, you may need to check the `AIRPORT` table for the specific airport codes associated with each city first.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers from Dallas to Houston based on the provided database schema, you would generally need to identify the airport codes associated with Dallas and Houston first and then query the flights based on those airport codes. Assuming you know the respective airport codes for Dallas and Houston, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DAL'  -- Replace 'DAL' with the actual airport code for Dallas
  AND TO_AIRPORT = 'HOU';    -- Replace 'HOU' with the actual airport code for Houston
```

In this example, replace 'DAL' and 'HOU' with the actual airport codes for the Dallas and Houston airports respectively (for example, DFW for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and IAH for George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston). If you need to retrieve the codes first, you could run:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Dallas%'
   OR AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Houston%';
```

This will help you find the correct airport codes to use in your flight query.

Question: flight number from HOUSTON to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight numbers for flights from Houston to Dallas, you would typically join several tables, including the `FLIGHT` table (where flight details are stored), the `AIRPORT` table (to get airport locations), and possibly the `CITY` table (to ensure you're looking for the right cities).

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'HOUSTON' AND 
    C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS';
```

### Explanation:
- We select the flight number from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (from Houston) and once for the destination airport (to Dallas).
- We also join the `CITY` table twice to ensure that we're filtering by the correct city names.
- The `WHERE` clause conditions ensure that we are specifically looking for flights departing from Houston to Dallas. 

Make sure to adjust table and column names if they differ in your actual database schema.

Question: flight numbers from CHICAGO to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight numbers from Chicago to Seattle based on the provided database schema, you will need to join relevant tables. The key tables include `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY`. The following SQL query assumes that you have the necessary data and that you want to find flight numbers departing from airports in Chicago and arriving at airports in Seattle:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY from_city ON from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = from_city.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY to_city ON to_airport.CITY_CODE = to_city.CITY_CODE
WHERE from_city.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO' AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Flight Numbers**: The `SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER` clause specifies that we want to retrieve the flight numbers.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table (`f`) with the `AIRPORT` table to get the departure and arrival airport codes.
   - We join again with the `CITY` table to find the cities corresponding to those airports.
3. **Filtering by City**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights where the departure city is Chicago and the arrival city is Seattle.

Make sure to adjust the `CITY_CODE` in the `CITY` table based on how it corresponds to the `AIRPORT` table if the data is structured differently.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY from_city ON from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE = from_city.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY to_city ON to_airport.CITY_CODE = to_city.CITY_CODE
WHERE from_city.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO' AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';

Question: please list all the flights from DALLAS to SAN FRANCISCO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all the flights from Dallas to San Francisco using the provided database schema, we must join the relevant tables to obtain the required information, such as flight details, departure and arrival airports, and any necessary relationships. Assuming "DALLAS" and "SAN FRANCISCO" are represented in the `CITY` table, we'll look for the corresponding airport codes for these cities in the `AIRPORT` table, followed by querying the `FLIGHT` table to find the flights matching those airport codes.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    CITY c_from ON a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = cs_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    CITY c_to ON a_to.AIRPORT_CODE = c_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' AND
    c_to.CITY_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Statement**: We retrieve information such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
2. **From Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT`, which contains records of all flights.
3. **Join Statements**: 
   - `FLIGHT` is joined with `AIRPORT` to get more details about the departure airport (`a_from`) and arrival airport (`a_to`).
   - Both `AIRPORT` tables are further joined with the `CITY` table to filter the records based on city names.
4. **Where Clause**: The conditions filter records where the From city is 'DALLAS' and the To city is 'SAN FRANCISCO'.

Make sure to replace the city names with the names that match your database exactly if they're different.

Question: tell me the flights that leave PHILADELPHIA and go to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights that leave Philadelphia and go to Dallas from the provided database schema, we will need to use the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to identify the correct airports for Philadelphia and Dallas. Given that we have the flights determined by their departure and arrival airport codes, we can construct the SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Philadelphia' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Dallas';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We select relevant fields such as flight ID, flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline code, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   
2. **FROM Clause**: We start from the `FLIGHT` table, as it holds the essential information about flight routes.
   
3. **JOIN Statements**: 
   - The first join (`A1`) connects to the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport details for the departure location (Philadelphia).
   - The second join (`A2`) connects to the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport details for the arrival location (Dallas).
   
4. **WHERE Clause**: We specify that the departure airport must be Philadelphia and the arrival airport must be Dallas.

Make sure to replace the names in the WHERE clause with the actual airport names or codes as necessary, depending on how the airport information is stored in your database. If the actual airport codes for Philadelphia and Dallas are needed, you can look them up in the `AIRPORT` table first.

WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ORLANDO';
```

This query selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and time elapsed. It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the origin (Houston) and once for the destination (Orlando). The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from Houston to Orlando.

If you want to include flights that have layovers (stopovers) in the query, you might need to look into the `FLIGHT_STOP` table as well, depending on how you want to approach it. If you would like further details on that, let me know!

Question: show me the flights between HOUSTON and ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights between Houston and Orlando, you would typically join several tables including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `FLIGHT_STOP` if you are interested in layovers as well. Here's a sample SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'HOUSTON' AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'ORLANDO';
```

Note: You need the correct city codes for Houston and Orlando in the `CITY` or `AIRPORT` tables. If those are not represented as city codes but rather by their airport codes (like IAH for George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and MCO for Orlando International Airport), you will need to filter based on the appropriate airport codes. 

Here’s an updated version that uses specific airport codes:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE IN ('IAH', 'HOU') -- Replace with the actual airport codes for Houston
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MCO'; -- Orlando International Airport code
```

Make sure to replace 'IAH', 'HOU', and 'MCO' with the correct airport codes as they appear in your database. This will provide you with a list of all flights from Houston to Orlando.

Question: show me the flights from HOUSTON to ORLANDO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Houston to Orlando based on the database schema you provided, you'll need to consider which airports correspond to these cities and then create a SQL query to obtain the relevant flight information.

Assuming HOUSTON corresponds to an airport code like "IAH" (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and ORLANDO corresponds to "MCO" (Orlando International Airport), the SQL query may look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    FL.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'HOUSTON' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ORLANDO';
```

### Notes:
1. Ensure to replace `A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION` and `A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION` with the appropriate column that identifies the location if `AIRPORT_LOCATION` isn't explicitly present in the `AIRPORT` table.
2. This query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
3. The conditions to identify Houston and Orlando need to suit the actual data structure, and airport code might also be used directly if known.

Question: what flights go from LONG BEACH to ST. LOUIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LONG BEACH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Long Beach to St. Louis, we need to join several tables in the database schema you've presented. Specifically, we will focus on the `FLIGHT` table to find flights and join with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for Long Beach and St. Louis. 

Assuming that "LONG BEACH" is in the `AIRPORT` table, we will first find the relevant airport codes for Long Beach and St. Louis and then filter flights based on those codes.

Here's a SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT f.airline_flight, f.flight_number, f.departure_time, f.arrival_time, f.from_airport, f.to_airport
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.from_airport = a_from.airport_code
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.to_airport = a_to.airport_code
WHERE a_from.airport_name = 'LONG BEACH'
AND a_to.airport_name = 'ST. LOUIS';
```

### Explanation:
- We select the necessary flight details from the `FLIGHT` table, including airline flight, flight number, departure and arrival times, and the airport codes for departure and destination.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the details of the departure airport (Long Beach) and once to get the details of the arrival airport (St. Louis).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to ensure that we only get flights departing from Long Beach and arriving in St. Louis. 

Make sure to replace 'LONG BEACH' and 'ST. LOUIS' with the actual names used in your `AIRPORT` table if they differ.

Question: what are the flights from MEMPHIS to LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Memphis to Las Vegas using the provided database schema, you need to join multiple tables, particularly the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially the `FLIGHT_FARE` or other related tables to get more details. Here's a SQL query that retrieves the desired flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Chooses specific columns to display, including the flight number, airline, departure/arrival times, stops, and the originating and destination airport names.
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Specifies that the primary table for retrieving flight information is the `FLIGHT` table, given the alias `f`.
- **JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE**: Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get details about the departure airport (Memphis).
- **JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE**: Joins again with the `AIRPORT` table to get the arrival airport (Las Vegas).
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Memphis and arriving in Las Vegas.

Make sure that the values for `a1.AIRPORT_NAME` and `a2.AIRPORT_NAME` match those stored in the database as you would need to know the actual airport names or codes. If you are aware of their airport codes, you can replace `AIRPORT_NAME` with `AIRPORT_CODE` for more accurate queries.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from LAS VEGAS to ONTARIO from the given database schema, you'll typically want to query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights with the desired origin and destination airports. You'll also need the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes for LAS VEGAS and ONTARIO.

Assuming you are looking for the flights from LAS VEGAS (LAS) to ONTARIO (ONT), the SQL query will look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ONTARIO';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM**: We are selecting data from the `FLIGHT` table (alias `F`).
- **JOIN**: We are joining the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - The first instance (`A1`) is for the departure airport (LAS VEGAS).
  - The second instance (`A2`) is for the arrival airport (ONTARIO).
- **SELECT**: We specify the columns we want to retrieve, including the flight details and airport names.
- **WHERE**: We filter the results to only include flights where the departure airport name is 'LAS VEGAS' and the arrival airport name is 'ONTARIO'. 

Make sure that you have the exact AIRPORT_CODE for LAS VEGAS and ONTARIO if they are not represented by these airport names in your database. If they are represented by different codes, you would replace 'LAS VEGAS' and 'ONTARIO' in the query with the corresponding airport codes.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Ontario (ONT) to Memphis (MEM) using the provided database schema, you’ll need to join several tables to gather relevant information about the flights, airlines, and airports. Here’s an SQL query to obtain those flight details:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ONT'
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MEM';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns to be returned, including flight details and airline name.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: This part indicates that we are querying from the `FLIGHT` table and giving it the alias `F` for easier reference.
- **JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE**: This joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the name of the airline for each flight.
- **WHERE**: This filters the results to include only those flights that depart from the Ontario airport (represented here by its code 'ONT') to the Memphis airport (represented by its code 'MEM').

Make sure to adjust the airport codes if they differ from the standard IATA codes used in your database for Ontario and Memphis.

Question: what are the flights from TAMPA to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Tampa to Milwaukee, we first need to identify the relevant airport codes for Tampa and Milwaukee. Once we have the airport codes, we can query the `FLIGHT` table to find all flights connecting these two airports. Below is an SQL query that shows how to achieve this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Get the airport codes for Tampa and Milwaukee
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
FROM AIRPORT 
WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Tampa' OR AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Milwaukee';

-- Assuming that the airport codes are 'TPA' for Tampa and 'MKE' for Milwaukee, 
-- we would use the following query to find flights:
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'TPA' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MKE';
```

Make sure to replace `'TPA'` and `'MKE'` with the actual airport codes based on the results from the first query.

This query selects flight details such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, stops, and time elapsed for flights departing from Tampa and arriving in Milwaukee.

Question: what are the flights from MILWAUKEE to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Milwaukee to Seattle, you'll need to join several tables that contain relevant information about flights, their origins, and destinations. The SQL query below assumes that "MILWAUKEE" corresponds to a specific `CITY_CODE` and that you have the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` information identifying the airports involved in these cities.

Here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT a.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT a JOIN CITY c ON a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c.CITY_CODE WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE')
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT a.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT a JOIN CITY c ON a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c.CITY_CODE WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE')
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns needed from the result set, including flight details and airport names.
   
2. **FROM**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table since we are querying flights.

3. **JOIN**: 
   - The `AIRPORT` table is joined twice to get the `FROM_AIRPORT` (in Milwaukee) and `TO_AIRPORT` (in Seattle).
   - The `CITY` table is also joined to filter based on the city names "MILWAUKEE" and "SEATTLE".

4. **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Seattle.

This query should successfully return all flights between Milwaukee and Seattle, including relevant details about the flights. Ensure that the airport codes for the mentioned cities in the database match what you are using in the query. Adjust the query if you have different identifiers for the cities or airports.

Question: please list the flights from LOS ANGELES to CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Los Angeles to Charlotte, you will need to join several tables to get the necessary information, such as flight IDs, departure and arrival airports, and relevant flight details. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.STOPS, 
    f.TIME_ELAPSED, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Los Angeles' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Charlotte';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table and the names of the airports from the `AIRPORT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Los Angeles) and once for the arrival airport (Charlotte).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from Los Angeles to Charlotte.

Make sure to replace 'Los Angeles' and 'Charlotte' with the exact airport names or airport codes if they differ in your database schema. If you need further specifics (like the exact airport codes), you might want to modify the query accordingly.

Question: please list the flights from CHARLOTTE to NEWARK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from CHARLOTTE to NEWARK, you will need to join several tables in your database schema, primarily focusing on the `FLIGHT` table for flight details, along with the `AIRPORT` table for airport information. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE' AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEWARK';
```

In this query:
- We select relevant fields including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, airport details, stops, and time elapsed.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (CHARLOTTE) and once for the arrival airport (NEWARK).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from CHARLOTTE to NEWARK. 

Make sure that the actual airport names `'CHARLOTTE'` and `'NEWARK'` match exactly as they appear in the database. If these are airport codes instead of names, you may need to adjust the query accordingly. For example, using `A1.AIRPORT_CODE` and `A2.AIRPORT_CODE` instead of `AIRPORT_NAME`.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Newark (EWR) to Los Angeles (LAX), we need to perform a SQL query that retrieves relevant flight information from the `FLIGHT` table, filtering by the departure airport (Newark) and the arrival airport (Los Angeles). We'll use the `FROM_AIRPORT` field for Newark and the `TO_AIRPORT` field for Los Angeles in the `FLIGHT` table.

Here is a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'EWR' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAX';
```

This query selects the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, number of stops, time elapsed, and connections for all flights from Newark (EWR) to Los Angeles (LAX).

Question: like to book a flight from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To book a flight from Burbank (BUR) to Milwaukee (MKE), you would typically follow steps to search for available flights, confirm flight details, and then insert the booking into the relevant tables. The SQL query could include selecting flights based on your criteria.

Here’s a simplified way to write an SQL query to find available flights from Burbank to Milwaukee:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR'
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MKE'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP; -- Assume we want future flights
```

### Explanation:
- This SQL query selects various columns from the `FLIGHT` table and joins it with the `AIRLINE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve details about available flights from Burbank (BUR) to Milwaukee (MKE).
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights to ensure they are departing from Burbank and going to Milwaukee, also ensuring that the departure time is set for the future.
  
### Booking:
After selecting an appropriate flight, the next steps would typically involve inserting a booking into the relevant tables with passenger details. Since flight booking usually entails various data points (which are likely held in other tables not defined here), that would require additional information.

If you need further SQL queries or details on how to execute the booking itself, please let me know!

Raw LLM Response:
To show all the flights from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table and join it with the relevant airport details to filter based on the departure airport (BURBANK) and the arrival airport (MILWAUKEE). The `FROM_AIRPORT` should correspond to the airport code for BURBANK, and the `TO_AIRPORT` should correspond to the airport code for MILWAUKEE. 

Assuming you have the airport codes for BURBANK and MILWAUKEE, you can write an SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR' AND  -- Replace 'BUR' with the actual IATA code for BURBANK
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MKE';      -- Replace 'MKE' with the actual IATA code for MILWAUKEE
```

Make sure to replace 'BUR' and 'MKE' with the actual airport codes if they are different. This query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the from and to airports, filtering flights that depart from Burbank and arrive in Milwaukee.

Question: find me all the flights from MILWAUKEE to ST. LOUIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from Milwaukee to St. Louis from the given database schema, you would need to access the `FLIGHT` table where the `FROM_AIRPORT` is Milwaukee and the `TO_AIRPORT` is St. Louis. 

However, the airport codes for Milwaukee and St. Louis airports are not specified in the provided schema, so you may need to look them up in the `AIRPORT` table where you can find the respective airport codes.

Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT F.*
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS';
```

This query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once to get the departure airport and once for the destination airport—filtering the results to only include flights from Milwaukee to St. Louis.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT F.*
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS';

Question: now show me all the flights from ST. LOUIS to BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights from ST. LOUIS to BURBANK, you first need to identify the respective airport codes for both cities. Assuming you already know the airport codes or have a way to query them, the SQL statement can be put together. Here’s a typical approach you might take:

1. Identify the airport codes for ST. LOUIS and BURBANK.
2. Execute the flight query using those airport codes.

Here's an SQL statement that demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_FROM ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_TO ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT_FROM.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS')
    AND AIRPORT_TO.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK');
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT statement**: Choosing columns to display such as flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure/arrival times, number of stops, elapsed time, airline name, and airport names.
2. **JOIN clauses**: Joining the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` for both departure and arrival airports, and with `AIRLINE` to get airline names.
3. **WHERE clause**: Filtering for flights that start in ST. LOUIS and arrive in BURBANK by matching the city codes. 

Make sure to have the correct city and airport names in the database to get the accurate results. If you want to use specific airport codes instead of city names, replace the subqueries in the WHERE clause with the respective airport codes.

Question: i want to book a flight from SALT LAKE CITY to WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To book a flight from Salt Lake City to Westchester County, you need to first identify the relevant information from the database schema, including airport codes for both cities, flight details, and flight fares. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown followed by an example SQL query:

1. **Find the Airport Codes**:
   - You need to find the airport code for Salt Lake City and Westchester County.

2. **Find Available Flights**:
   - Once you have the airport codes, you can look for flights between the two airports.

3. **Retrieve Flight Fares**:
   - Gather information regarding the fares for those flights.

Below is a SQL script that follows this process:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find the airport codes for Salt Lake City and Westchester County
WITH AirportCodes AS (
    SELECT CITY_CODE, AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%'
       OR AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WESTCHESTER COUNTY%'
)

-- Step 2: Find flights from Salt Lake City to Westchester County
SELECT F.FLIGHT_ID, F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, F.AIRLINE_CODE, F.DEPARTURE_TIME, F.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AirportCodes AC_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AC_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AirportCodes AC_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AC_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AC_FROM.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM AirportCodes WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%')
  AND AC_TO.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM AirportCodes WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WESTCHESTER COUNTY%');
```

### Explanation:
- The Common Table Expression (CTE) `AirportCodes` retrieves the airport codes for both cities.
- The main query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the results of the CTE to filter flights that depart from Salt Lake City and arrive at Westchester County.
- Finally, it selects relevant flight details such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME`.

### Additional Steps:
After obtaining the flight information, you can further query for fares using the `FARE` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables based on the selected flight before finalizing the booking.

Make sure you adjust conditions in the `LIKE` clauses based on the exact names in the database if needed, as the query uses partial matches for city names.

Question: find me a flight that flies from MEMPHIS to TACOMA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TACOMA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight that flies from Memphis to Tacoma, you need to consider the relevant tables in your schema, specifically the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT`. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

1. Identify the `CITY_CODE` for Memphis and Tacoma using the `CITY` table.
2. Find the corresponding `AIRPORT_CODE` for the airports in those cities using the `AIRPORT` table.
3. Look for flights in the `FLIGHT` table that match the departure airport (Memphis) and the arrival airport (Tacoma).

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT asr.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE asr WHERE asr.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT asr.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE asr WHERE asr.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE)
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'TACOMA';
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant flight details (like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, etc.) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the airport details for both Memphis and Tacoma.
- We join both airports to the `CITY` table to filter based on the city names.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that we are only fetching flights that originate from the Memphis airport and land at the Tacoma airport. 

Make sure your database has the appropriate data to execute this query successfully!

    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%DENVER%';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: This specifies the fields that you want to retrieve, including flight details and airport names.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: The main table here is `FLIGHT`, which contains the flight information.

3. **JOIN Statements**: 
   - The first JOIN is between the `FLIGHT` table and the `AIRPORT` table for departures (Washington). 
   - The second JOIN is for arrivals (Denver).
  
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights that depart from airports in Washington and arrive at airports in Denver. The `LIKE` condition is used to facilitate searches based on the airport locations, which might include variations in the exact naming.

### Note:
If you want to specify exact airport codes instead of searching by name or city, ensure that you have the correct airport codes for Washington and Denver from the `AIRPORT` table. For example, you might use 'DCA' for Washington National and 'DEN' for Denver International. Adjust the WHERE clause accordingly.

Question: get fares from WASHINGTON to BOSTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Washington to Boston using the provided database schema, you would typically need to gather information from the `FARE` table, filtering based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`. However, we first must ensure that we have the correct airport codes for Washington and Boston to use in our query.

Let’s assume that the airport codes for Washington and Boston are, respectively, `DCA` (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) for Washington and `BOS` (Logan International Airport) for Boston. 

Here's an SQL query that retrieves available fares from Washington to Boston:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID, 
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    F.FARE_AIRLINE, 
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DCA' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BOS';
```

Make sure to replace `DCA` and `BOS` with the actual airport codes if they differ. This query selects the fare ID, fare basis code, airline, one-way cost, and round-trip cost for flights from Washington to Boston.

Question: get fares from WASHINGTON to MONTREAL
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MONTREAL" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve fares from Washington to Montreal, you would typically need to join the relevant tables that connect both the airports in Washington and Montreal, the fare information, and the associated flight details. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FARE_ID,
    F.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    F.FARE_AIRLINE,
    F.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    F.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%' AND 
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%MONTREAL%';
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant columns from the `FARE` table, along with airport names for clarity.
- We perform joins on the `AIRPORT` table twice, once to bring in the airport information for Washington and once for Montreal.
- The `LIKE` operator is used in the WHERE clause to match any potential variations in the names of the airports associated with Washington and Montreal.
  
Make sure to replace the `LIKE` filters with the actual airport codes or names specific to your database if you have exact names or codes for the airports in question (e.g., IAD for Washington Dulles International and YUL for Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International).

Question: i need a ticket from NASHVILLE to SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a fare for a ticket from Nashville (NASHVILLE being the city code) to Seattle, you will need to gather several pieces of information. However, first, you may need to identify the corresponding airport codes for both cities. Let's assume you have already identified that the airport code for Nashville is BNA and for Seattle is SEA.

With that information, here’s an SQL query you could use to fetch ticket information, including flight options and associated fare details:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FA.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BNA'    -- Nashville Airport Code
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'   -- Seattle Airport Code;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT** clause: Retrieves relevant flight and fare details, like flight numbers, departure and arrival times, connections, stops, and fare costs.
- **FROM** and **JOIN** clauses: We are pulling data from the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables, where the `FLIGHT_ID` connects the flights to their respective fares.
- **WHERE** clause: Filters for flights specifically departing from Nashville (BNA) to Seattle (SEA).

Make sure to adjust airport codes as necessary according to your database records. Also, feel free to include additional parameters or conditions based on your specific requirements (e.g., specific dates, number of passengers, fare type, etc.).

Question: please list all flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI any any type of class
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights from New York to Miami for any class of service, you'll need to perform a SQL query that joins relevant tables. You will primarily be joining the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to filter by the airports of the departure and arrival cities. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'MIAMI';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Selects relevant information about the flights.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table aliased as `F`.
- **JOINs**: 
  - Joins the `AIRPORT` table (aliased as `A1` for the departure airport and `A2` for the arrival airport) to get the corresponding airport names.
  - Joins the `CITY` table (aliased as `C1` for New York and `C2` for Miami) to filter by city names.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only those flights departing from New York and arriving in Miami.

You may run this query on your SQL database to get the desired results.

To retrieve the flights from Boston to Orlando that stop in New York, we need to join several tables based on relevant criteria. Specifically, we'll be looking for flights where:

1. The departure airport is Boston.
2. The destination airport is Orlando.
3. There is a stop in New York.

Assuming uppercase city names correspond to appropriate city codes (for example, `BOSTON` corresponds to `CITY_CODE` for Boston, `ORLANDO` corresponds to `CITY_CODE` for Orlando, and `NEW YORK` for New York), the following SQL query can be constructed:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FS.STOP_AIRPORT,
    FS.ARRIVAL_TIME AS STOP_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FS.DEPARTURE_TIME AS STOP_DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A3 ON FS.STOP_AIRPORT = A3.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
    AND A3.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:

- **FROM FLIGHT F**: This is the main table that contains details about flights.
- **JOIN FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID**: This joins the flight stops to check where the flights stop.
- **JOIN AIRPORT A1, A2, A3**: These joins determine the airports involved. A1 is for the departure airport (Boston), A2 is for the destination airport (Orlando), and A3 is for the stop airport (New York).
- **WHERE clause**: This filters the results to only include flights that originate from Boston, are heading to Orlando, and make a stop in New York.

Make sure to check actual city and airport codes in your database, as airport names might not exactly match the ones used here, and replace them with the appropriate codes where necessary.

To find a flight from Memphis to Tacoma that goes through Los Angeles, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables to ensure that the flight includes a stop in Los Angeles (LAX) between the departure from Memphis (MEM) and arrival in Tacoma (SEA):

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fs1.STOP_AIRPORT AS FIRST_STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs2.STOP_AIRPORT AS SECOND_STOP_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs1 ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs2 ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs2.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MEM' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
    AND fs1.STOP_AIRPORT = 'LAX'
    AND fs2.STOP_AIRPORT = 'LAX'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

In this SQL query:

- We select relevant flight information such as flight number, departure and arrival times, airline code, and time elapsed.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `FLIGHT_STOP` twice to identify that the flight stops in Los Angeles at least once.
- We filter the flights that are departing from Memphis (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'MEM'`) and arriving in Tacoma (`TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA'`) with a stop in Los Angeles (`STOP_AIRPORT = 'LAX'`).
- Order the results by departure time for easier scheduling.

Make sure to verify the airport codes for Memphis, Tacoma, and Los Angeles as appropriate for your database. The codes provided (e.g., `'MEM'`, `'SEA'`, and `'LAX'`) should be replaced if necessary based on the full dataset.

To find flights from Ontario to Westchester County that stop in Chicago, you'll need to join several tables based on your schema. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_NUMBER,
    fs.ARRIVAL_AIRLINE,
    fs.DEPARTURE_AIRLINE,
    fs.STOP_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Ontario'
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Westchester County'
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'Chicago';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Select Statement**: The query selects flight details and details about the stop in Chicago.
   
2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is the `FLIGHT` table, which holds details about the flights.

3. **JOIN Operations**:
   - `FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID` - This join is to get details about the stops made by the flights.
   - `AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE` - This join is to retrieve the airport details for the departure airport (Ontario).
   - `AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE` - This join is to retrieve the airport details for the arrival airport (Westchester County).

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Checks that the departure airport is Ontario and the arrival airport is Westchester County.
   - Also checks that there is a stop at Chicago.

Make sure that `AIRPORT_NAME` values for "Ontario", "Westchester County", and "Chicago" correctly reflect the actual names in your `AIRPORT` table. Adjust them if necessary.

To find a flight from Memphis to Tacoma with a stop in Los Angeles, you'll need to join several tables to get the relevant flight information. Here is a SQL query that does just that, making assumptions about table relationships based on the schema you've provided:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    fa1.FROM_AIRPORT AS 'Departure Airport',
    fa2.TO_AIRPORT AS 'Arrival Airport',
    fa3.AIRPORT_NAME AS 'Stopover Airport',
    fa3.AIRPORT_CODE AS 'Stopover Code',
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT fa1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = fa1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT fa2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = fa2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT fa3 ON fs.STOP_AIRPORT = fa3.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN

JOIN 
    CITY c3 ON fa3.CITY_CODE = c3.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND c3.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES'
    AND fa2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TACOMA';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting flight details such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and the associated airports.
- The `FLIGHT` table (`f`) represents the main flight data.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table thrice to get details for the departure airport (Memphis), arrival airport (Tacoma), and stopover airport (Los Angeles).
- The `FLIGHT_STOP` table is used to ensure we are looking at flights with stops and allows us to filter for Los Angeles specifically.
- We filter the results to flights departing from Memphis and arriving in Tacoma while making a stop in Los Angeles.

Make sure to adjust the `TO_AIRPORT` check according to the actual airport codes for Tacoma if needed. The query assumes you are using the names directly from the `CITY` table.

To retrieve all Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Montreal to Orlando, you'll need to execute a SQL query that filters records from the `FLIGHT` table based on the departure airport (Montreal) and the arrival airport (Orlando). You might also need to identify the airport codes for Montreal and Orlando from the `AIRPORT` table. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT F.*
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Montreal' 
  AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando'
  AND F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL';
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHT F` selects all flight records.
- `JOIN AIRPORT A1` joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the departure airport (Montreal).
- `JOIN AIRPORT A2` joins again with the `AIRPORT` table to get details for the arrival airport (Orlando).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from Montreal and arriving in Orlando, specifically those operated by Delta Airlines (`DL`).

### Note:
Make sure to adjust the airport names based on the actual names stored in your `AIRPORT` table if they differ from "Montreal" and "Orlando". Alternatively, if you have the specific airport codes for both cities, you can directly filter by those codes for more accuracy.

Question: list DL flights from SEATTLE to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Seattle (SEA) to Salt Lake City (SLC), you can perform a SQL query that includes several joins across the relevant tables in the database schema. Below is an example of such a query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
    AND A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SEA' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SLC';
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause retrieves relevant columns of interest, including the flight number, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and relevant airport names.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Seattle) and once for the arrival airport (Salt Lake City).
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that we want flights operated by Delta Airlines (`'DL'`) and that are departing from Seattle (`'SEA'`) to Salt Lake City (`'SLC'`). 

Make sure that the identifiers used for the airport codes (`SEA` for Seattle and `SLC` for Salt Lake City) are accurate based on your database contents.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee on American Airlines (AA), you would need to perform a query that joins several tables to get the required information. Below is an example of an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
       FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       FLIGHT.STOPS, 
       FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
       FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
FROM FLIGHT 
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FARE.FARE_ID 
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHOENIX' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
  AND FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:

- The query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table.
- It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get details about the departure airport (Phoenix) and once for the arrival airport (Milwaukee).
- It also joins the `FARE` table to fetch fare details associated with the flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee operated by American Airlines (AA).

Note: Modify the conditions in the `WHERE` clause based on the exact names of the airports in your database if they differ from my assumptions.

Question: flight numbers on AA from PHOENIX to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers for American Airlines (AA) from Phoenix (PHX) to Milwaukee (MKE), you will need to join the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially other relevant tables to filter for the specified airline and airports.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
  AND AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX'
  AND AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MKE';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We're selecting the `FLIGHT_NUMBER` from the `FLIGHT` table (`F`).
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table (`A`) on the `AIRLINE_CODE`.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table (`AP_FROM` and `AP_TO`) to get the from and to airport details.
- We apply filters in the `WHERE` clause to ensure we're only getting flights operated by American Airlines (identified by the code 'AA') and from the 'PHX' airport to the 'MKE' airport.

Make sure the airport codes ('PHX' for Phoenix and 'MKE' for Milwaukee) match the codes used in your database.

Question: flight numbers from CHICAGO to SEATTLE on CO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flight numbers from Chicago to Seattle operated by Continental Airlines (CO), you would need to query the `FLIGHT` table and filter based on the relevant city codes for Chicago and Seattle. You would also need to join with the `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and possibly other tables to get the correct airport codes if you do not already have them.

Assuming you know the airport codes for Chicago (ORD for O'Hare International Airport) and Seattle (SEA for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport), the SQL query would be as follows:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ORD' AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SEA' AND AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO';
```

In case you need to retrieve the airport codes based on city names, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY AS TO_CITY ON TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO' AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE' AND AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO';
```

Make sure to replace 'ORD' and 'SEA' with the corresponding airport codes of Chicago and Seattle if they differ.

In this query:
- We select the `FLIGHT_NUMBER` from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Seattle) and once for the arrival airport (Chicago).
- We filter the results to include flights that depart from Seattle and arrive in Chicago, specifically for Continental Airlines (CO). 

Make sure that the airport names ('Seattle' and 'Chicago') match exactly with how they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table, or adjust the conditions as necessary if the airport names differ.

Question: show DL from BOSTON to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show flight details for Delta Airlines (DL) from Boston to Salt Lake City, you will need to join several tables from the provided database schema. Here’s a SQL query to retrieve the necessary information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    FS.FARE_ID,
    FT.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FT.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FS.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FT ON FS.FARE_ID = FT.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'
    AND A1.CITY_CODE = (
        SELECT CITY_CODE 
        FROM CITY 
        WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON'
    )
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (
        SELECT CITY_CODE 
        FROM CITY 
        WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
    );
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting relevant columns, including flight number, departure time, arrival time, departure airport name, and arrival airport name.
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined to the `AIRPORT` table twice to get names of both departure and arrival airports.
- We also join with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve fare details related to each flight.
- The `WHERE` clause filters to show only Delta Airlines (`'DL'`) flights, and conditions on departure from Boston and arrival at Salt Lake City, using subqueries to retrieve corresponding city codes.

Make sure the city names (`BOSTON`, `SALT LAKE CITY`) and other references correctly match those in your database for accurate results.

Question: show DL flights from BOSTON to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Boston to Salt Lake City based on the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that Boston and Salt Lake City can be identified by their airport codes (for example, BOS for Boston Logan International Airport and SLC for Salt Lake City International Airport). 

Here's an example of a SQL query you might use:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' AND 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC';
```

This query specifically looks for flights operated by Delta Airlines (`AIRLINE_CODE` = 'DL') departing from Boston (`FROM_AIRPORT` = 'BOS') and arriving in Salt Lake City (`TO_AIRPORT` = 'SLC'). 

Make sure to adjust the airport codes (`BOS` and `SLC`) if your database uses different codes for these locations.

Question: show DL flights from BOSTON to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights operated by Delta Airlines (typically abbreviated as "DL") from Boston to Salt Lake City, you'll need to query the `FLIGHT` table, along with referencing the relevant entries in the `AIRPORT` table to get the specific airport codes for Boston and Salt Lake City.

We'll assume that the airport codes for Boston and Salt Lake City are "BOS" and "SLC", respectively. To obtain the desired information, the SQL query could look like the following:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
    AND A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We define the columns we want to retrieve:
   - `AIRLINE_CODE` and `FLIGHT_NUMBER`: To identify the flight.
   - `DEPARTURE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_TIME`: Flight schedule.
   - Names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: We use the `FLIGHT` table as the main source of data.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice; one for the departure airport (`A1`) and one for the arrival airport (`A2`).

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filtering for flights operated by Delta Airlines (`F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'`).
   - Ensuring flights are from Boston and to Salt Lake City based on their names.

Make sure to adjust the airport names or codes if they differ based on your actual database's data.

Question: i would like a flight from CINCINNATI to BURBANK on AA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from Cincinnati to Burbank on American Airlines (AA), you would typically need to join several tables in the database schema you provided. Here’s an SQL query that captures the relevant information, assuming that Cincinnati's airport code is `CVG` and Burbank's airport code is `BUR`. 

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'CVG' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR' AND 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:
1. The `SELECT` statement retrieves relevant columns including flight number, departure and arrival times, airline code, and airport names.
2. The `FROM` clause specifies `FLIGHT` as the main table.
3. Two JOINs with the `AIRPORT` table fetch the names of the departure and arrival airports based on their airport codes.
4. The `WHERE` clause filters results to only include flights from Cincinnati (`CVG`) to Burbank (`BUR`) operated by American Airlines (`AA`).

Make sure to adjust the airport codes (`CVG` and `BUR`) and airline code (`AA`) if they differ from what I assumed based on common airport code conventions.

Question: what are the AA flights from NEWARK to NASHVILLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark to Nashville, you would need to perform a SQL query that joins the relevant tables to filter the data correctly. Here's an example SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    al.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' AND
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR' AND -- Newark Airport Code
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BNA';     -- Nashville Airport Code
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: You select relevant columns, including flight details and airport names.
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which contains flight details.
- **JOIN**: This clause joins the tables `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT` for both the departure and arrival locations to get airport names.
- **WHERE**: This clause filters results to only include flights where the airline is American Airlines (AA) and the departure airport is Newark (EWR) and the destination airport is Nashville (BNA).

You might need to adjust the airport codes ('EWR' for Newark and 'BNA' for Nashville) if they are not the correct codes in your database.

Question: please list the flights from CINCINNATI to BURBANK on AA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Cincinnati to Burbank operated by American Airlines (AA), you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the necessary relationships between the tables are appropriately defined and that you have the relevant airport codes for Cincinnati and Burbank.

Here's a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.STOPS,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI') 
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'BURBANK') 
    AND f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects important flight details such as flight ID, flight number, departure time, arrival time, the number of stops, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **Joining Tables**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once to get the details for the departure airport (Cincinnati) and once for the arrival airport (Burbank).

3. **Filtering Conditions**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from Cincinnati to Burbank specifically.
   - Subqueries are used to obtain the `CITY_CODE` for both Cincinnati and Burbank from the `CITY` table.
   - An additional condition is added to ensure that the airline is American Airlines (`AA`).

Make sure to execute this query in an environment where your database is set up and contains the relevant information. Adjust the `CITY_CODE` subqueries if the actual city names differ in your database.

Question: i'd like to fly from MIAMI to CHICAGO on AA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Miami to Chicago on American Airlines (AA), you would typically need to query the `FLIGHT` table along with others to get detailed information about the flights, such as the airports, flight details, and aircraft. Here is an SQL query that can achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%MIAMI%' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%CHICAGO%' 
    AND F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Retrieve necessary flight details, including flight number, departure and arrival times, elapsed time, number of stops, meal code, and days of operation.
2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table being queried is `FLIGHT`.
3. **JOINs**: Join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both the departure (Miami) and arrival (Chicago) airports.
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters the results to only include flights from Miami to Chicago.
   - Ensures that the flights are operated by American Airlines (AA).

### Notes:
- Depending on how airport locations are structured in the `AIRPORT` table, the WHERE clause may require adjustments (such as using specific airport codes for Miami and Chicago, like `MIA` and `ORD`).
- This query assumes you want all flights on any given day and doesn't filter by a specific date or time.
- The `MEAL_CODE` field may need to be expanded to include a join with the `FOOD_SERVICE` table if you wish to obtain detailed meal descriptions.

Question: is there TAXI service at the ONT airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "ONT" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "TAXI" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is taxi service at the ONT airport (Ontario International Airport), you would need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, using the `AIRPORT_CODE` for ONT and filtering by the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` for taxi services. 

Here is a sample SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'ONT' AND TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'Taxi';
```

This query will return any rows that match ONT as the airport code and 'Taxi' as the type of ground service. If any rows are returned, it indicates that there is taxi service available at the ONT airport. If no rows are returned, it means there is currently no taxi service listed for that airport.

SELECT *
FROM GROUND_SERVICE
WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'ONT' AND TRANSPORT_TYPE = 'Taxi';

Question: how much is COACH flight from PITTSBURGH to ATLANTA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ATLANTA" AND FAREalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FAREalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the cost of a COACH flight from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Atlanta (ATL), you need to join several tables based on the relationships defined in your schema. We'll focus on the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and potentially `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` tables to get the correct fare based on the booking class (in this case, COACH).

Here is an SQL query that retrieves the cost of a COACH flight from Pittsburgh to Atlanta:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'ATL'
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'COACH';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query retrieves relevant columns like `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, and `ROUND_TRIP_COST` for the result set.
  
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to associate flights with their respective fares.
   - The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is then joined with the `FARE` table to obtain fare details.
   - The `FARE` table is joined with `FARE_BASIS` to filter the fare based on the booking class.

3. **Filtering Conditions**: The query applies filters on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns to specify the source and destination airports. It also checks that the `BOOKING_CLASS` matches 'COACH' to get the desired fare class. 

### Notes:
- Make sure that the airport codes ('PIT' and 'ATL') are correct according to the entries in your database schema.
- The query will return all available COACH flights from Pittsburgh to Atlanta along with their one-way and round-trip costs if they exist. If there are no flights, the result will be empty.

Question: which airlines fly between TORONTO and SAN DIEGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TORONTO" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN DIEGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find which airlines fly between Toronto and San Diego, you'll typically need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRLINE`. You'll look for flights originating from Toronto and arriving in San Diego. Assuming that "Toronto" and "San Diego" correspond to their respective airport codes (let's say `YYZ` for Toronto Pearson International Airport and `SAN` for San Diego International Airport), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT AP_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE AP_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%TORONTO%'
  AND AP_TO.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SAN DIEGO%';
```

This query performs the following actions:
- Selects distinct airline names from the `AIRLINE` table.
- Joins the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRPORT` table to find flights from the Toronto airport and to the San Diego airport.
- Filters the results where the departure airport is in Toronto and the arrival airport is in San Diego.

Make sure to replace `'%TORONTO%'` and `'%SAN DIEGO%'` with the correct airport names or airport codes as needed.

Question: list airlines that fly from SEATTLE to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list airlines that fly from Seattle to Salt Lake City, you will need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially others to filter results correctly. Below is an SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SEATTLE%'
AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%';
```

### Explanation:
- **`SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_NAME`**: This selects unique airline names to avoid duplicates in the results.
- **`FROM FLIGHT f`**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table, aliased as `f`.
- **`JOIN AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE`**: Joins the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names.
- **`JOIN AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE`**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport details for the departure airport.
- **`JOIN AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE`**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table again to get the airport details for the arrival airport.
- **`WHERE from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SEATTLE%'`**: Filters to include only flights departing from airports in Seattle.
- **`AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%'`**: Filters to include only flights arriving at airports in Salt Lake City.

This query will return the names of airlines that have flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City.

Question: which flights go from NEW YORK to MIAMI and back
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights that go from New York to Miami and back, you will need to join multiple tables, specifically the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables to obtain accurate location and airport details. Assuming that you have unique identifiers for the airports in New York and Miami, we need to know their airport codes.

Here is a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_To_Miami,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline_To_Miami,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time_To_Miami,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time_To_Miami,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_To_New_York,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS Airline_To_New_York,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time_To_New_York,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time_From_New_York
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID <> f2.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'NEW YORK')
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MIAMI')
    AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MIAMI')
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT IN (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'NEW YORK');
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight numbers and airline codes for two segments: the flight from New York to Miami (`f1`) and the return flight from Miami to New York (`f2`).
- We perform a self-join on the `FLIGHT` table to find corresponding return flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights based on the airport codes for New York and Miami, by using subqueries to get the relevant airport codes from the `AIRPORT` table.
- It is assumed that there are airport codes linked to the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` of 'NEW YORK' and 'MIAMI'. Adjust the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` values as needed to match the schema's actual values.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the airport codes in the `CITY` or `AIRPORT` tables are set accurately for New York and Miami.
- Adjust the departure and arrival times formats as needed based on your requirements for presentation.
- Depending on the structure and intent of your database, additional conditions may be necessary to filter flights, such as a specific date or time range.

    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MONTREAL' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming this indicates a round trip
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT** clause: This selects the needed fields for outbound and return flights, such as flight numbers, departure/arrival times, airline names, and fare costs.
- **FROM** and **JOIN** clause: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `AIRLINE` tables to obtain the required information based on the FROM and TO airport codes.
- **WHERE** clause: Filter the results to ensure that flights are specifically from Orlando to Montreal and require a round trip.

Please make sure to adapt any specific column names or conditions based on actual schema and data requirements, like the exact representation of round trip requirements and joins depending on relationships.

To retrieve round trip flights from Burbank (BUR) to Seattle (SEA), you will need to join the relevant tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE`, considering you want round-trip costs. Below is an SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SEA' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' denotes round trip required
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns we want to retrieve, including flight information and fare details.
- The `FROM` clause indicates that we're starting with the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Burbank) and once for the arrival airport (Seattle).
- The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is joined to connect the flights to their respective fare details, and then we further join with the `FARE` table to get the cost, specifically checking for round trip flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights from Burbank to Seattle and ensures that only those fares defined for round-trips (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`) are included. 

Make sure to adjust the conditions based on your specific database schema constraints or requirements if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To query round trip flights from Orlando to Montreal, you'll need to fetch data from several tables to gather all relevant information such as flights, airports, and fares. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Flight_Number,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS Departure_Airport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS Arrival_Airport,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Cost,
    cs.CLASS_DESCRIPTION AS Class_Description
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE cs ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = cs.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Montreal' AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: This part selects the flight number, departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, cost of the round trip, and the class description.
- **FROM and JOIN**: This specifies the main table (`FLIGHT`) and joins it with the `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` tables to get more information about the flights corresponding to Orlando and Montreal.
- **WHERE**: This condition is used to filter the flights that are departing from Orlando to Montreal, and it checks that the fare is indeed a round trip (ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y').

### Note:
- Make sure to check the actual names of the airports in the `AIRPORT` table as they can have different names or codes. This SQL assumes that you've used the airport names 'Orlando' and 'Montreal' directly, and they match the entries in your database.
- If city names are required, you will need to adjust the joins accordingly to incorporate the `CITY` table as needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To show round trips between Montreal and Orlando based on the provided database schema, you will need to join multiple tables to retrieve the relevant flight information, including departure and return flights. Below is an example SQL query that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Departure_Flight_Number,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Return_Flight_Number,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Return_Departure_Time,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Return_Arrival_Time,
    a1.AIRLINE_NAME AS Departure_Airline,
    a2.AIRLINE_NAME AS Return_Airline,
    f1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS Departure_Fare,
    f2.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS Return_Fare
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a1 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = a1.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = f1.FLIGHT_ID -- Assuming the same flight ID for a round trip
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a2 ON f2.AIRLINE_CODE = a2.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' AND -- IATA code for Montreal
    f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND -- IATA code for Orlando
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND
    f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'YUL'
ORDER BY 
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:

- **FLIGHT f1**: Represents the outbound flight from Montreal to Orlando.
- **FLIGHT f2**: Represents the return flight from Orlando to Montreal.
- **JOIN AIRLINE a1/a2**: Joins the airline table to fetch airline names for both departure and return flights.
- **WHERE clause**: Filters results to ensure that we are only retrieving flights from Montreal (YUL) to Orlando (MCO) and vice versa.
- **ORDER BY**: Arranges the results by the departure time of the outbound flight.

Note: 
1. Adjust the `WHERE` conditions according to your database's exact codes for Montreal and Orlando (in this case, YUL for Montreal and MCO for Orlando).
2. You may also want to take into consideration the flight days and applicable fare types or restrictions based on your business logic or requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flights from Montreal to Orlando, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the airport codes for Montreal and Orlando are known (for example, `YUL` for Montreal and `MCO` for Orlando). Make sure to replace these codes with the actual airport codes if they are different.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' -- Assuming MCO is the airport code for Orlando
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' -- Assuming YUL is the airport code for Montreal
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y' -- Ensuring that the fare is for round trip
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '60 days' -- Example filter on flight dates
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'YUL' -- Return flight should go back to Montreal
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Flight Selection**:
   - We select outbound flights from Montreal (assumed airport code 'YUL') to Orlando ('MCO').
2. **Join with Flight Fare**:
   - Join the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables to get fare information.
3. **Round Trip Filter**:
   - Filter on `fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` to ensure only round trip fares are selected.
4. **Join for Return Flight**:
   - Create a join to find matching return flights from Orlando to Montreal.
5. **Date Filtering**:
   - You can filter the flights based on the desired departure date range.
6. **Ordering Results**:
   - Order the results by outbound departure time.

Make sure to adjust the airport codes and any other conditions based on actual data requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round-trip flights from Burbank to Tacoma from the database, you'll need to join several tables relevant to flights, expenses, and airport information. Below is a sample SQL query that demonstrates how to achieve this by querying the required tables based on the available schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS FlightNumber,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE AS AirlineCode,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FromAirport,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ToAirport,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DepartureTime,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ArrivalTime,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS RoundTripCost
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TACOMA' AND
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' means required for round-trip
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: You select relevant fields, including the flight number, airline code, the names of the departure (Burbank) and arrival airports (Tacoma), departure and arrival times, and the round-trip cost.

2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which holds information about flights.

3. **JOINs**: 
   - You join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   - You join the `FARE` table to get pricing information related to the flight.

4. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the flights to only include those from Burbank to Tacoma and ensures that the fare is marked for round trips.

### Note:
- Ensure the airport names (Burbank and Tacoma) match the actual values stored in the `AIRPORT` table.
- The `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field in the `FARE` table should be verified for the actual values representing a round trip, as it might differ (e.g., it could be a boolean or numeric value). Adjust the condition accordingly.

Question: i would like to book a round trip flight from KANSAS CITY to CHICAGO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To book a round trip flight from Kansas City to Chicago using the provided database schema, we need to perform a series of steps. This involves selecting a flight that meets the requirements and fetching the associated fare information. 

Assuming you have flight dates and times in mind, let’s create a hypothetical SQL query that retrieves information for a round trip from Kansas City (Airport Code from the `AIRPORT` table) to Chicago (Airport Code from `AIRPORT` table) using the relevant tables.

1. First, we need to identify the airport codes for Kansas City and Chicago.
2. Then, we'll select round trip flights between these two airports.
3. We'll optionally filter on dates depending on your travel preferences.
4. Finally, we’ll pull fare information from the `FARE` table.

Here is an SQL query that may represent a simple scenario of retrieving available round trip flights:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find airport codes
WITH airport_kc AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
    FROM AIRPORT 
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Kansas City%'
),
airport_chi AS (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
    FROM AIRPORT 
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Chicago%'
)

-- Step 2: Retrieve flights from Kansas City to Chicago
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Departure_Flight_Number,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Departure_Time,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Arrival_Time,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRLINE_NAME AS Airline,
    F1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS Return_Flight_Number,
    F1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS Return_Departure_Time,
    F1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS Return_Arrival_Time,
    A2.AIRLINE_NAME AS Return_Airline,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    airport_kc AK ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AK.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    airport_chi AC ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AC.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F1 ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = F1.AIRLINE_CODE AND F1.FROM_AIRPORT = AC.AIRPORT_CODE AND F1.TO_AIRPORT = AK.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FA.FROM_AIRPORT = AK.AIRPORT_CODE AND FA.TO_AIRPORT = AC.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A1 ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A1.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A2 ON F1.AIRLINE_CODE = A2.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- Filter for future flights
    AND F1.DEPARTURE_TIME > F.ARRIVAL_TIME; -- Return flight should be after the arrival of the departure flight
```

**Explanation:**
- The query first finds the airport codes for Kansas City and Chicago.
- Then, it selects flights departing from Kansas City to Chicago.
- It looks for return flights from Chicago back to Kansas City.
- Joins are made with the `FARE` and `AIRLINE` tables to get fare and airline details.
- The last part of the WHERE clause filters out flights that have already occurred and ensures that the return flight is after the departure flight.

Please adjust the SQL based on your specific needs (e.g., the actual time frames for the trips, specific classes of service, etc.) and ensure that your DBMS supports Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and the SQL syntax used here.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Kansas City to Las Vegas in economy class, you will need to join several tables in the database schema you've provided. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this based on the information necessary to identify the route, retrieve economy class fares, and include relevant details about the flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    co.CLASS_DESCRIPTION AS CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE co ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = co.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS')
    AND co.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Economy'
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- We start by selecting relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains information about the flights, including departure and arrival times, airline code, and flight number.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the full names of the 'FROM' and 'TO' airports based on the airport codes in the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is joined to link flights to their corresponding fare information.
- The `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables are joined to access fare details and specifically filter them based on the economy class.
- We filter the results to only include flights from Kansas City to Las Vegas and limit the selection to economy class fares.

### Note:
- Ensure that the `CITY` table contains the exact names "KANSAS CITY" and "LAS VEGAS". You may need to verify the actual names used in your database.
- Adjust column names and conditions based on the actual schema and data types, if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To generate an SQL query for retrieving economy flight options from Kansas City (KANSAS CITY) to Las Vegas (LAS VEGAS), we will need to join several tables from the provided schema. We will particularly focus on the `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `CITY` tables to find the required information.

Here's how to structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID IN (
        SELECT ff.FARE_ID 
        FROM FLIGHT_FARE ff 
        WHERE ff.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
    )
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
    AND fb.ECONOMY = 'Y'; -- Ensure we are fetching economy fares
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting relevant fields like flight number, departure and arrival times, airport names, and fare costs.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get information for both the departure from Kansas City and the arrival in Las Vegas.
- The `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables are joined to filter the results for economy bookings.
- The `CITY` table is used to ensure we are matching the correct city names for Kansas City and Las Vegas.
- The condition `fb.ECONOMY = 'Y'` ensures we are only looking for economy-class fares.

Make sure to adapt the table structure (e.g., `AIRPORT_LOCATION` in the `CITY` table) according to your database specifics if they differ from what I assumed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore in economy class, you will likely need to join several tables, including AIRPORT, FLIGHT, FARE, and FARE_BASIS. Here is a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DURATION,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND fb.CLASS_TYPE = 'ECONOMY';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specify the columns you want to retrieve, including flight numbers, departure and arrival times, and costs.
- **FROM**: Start with the `FLIGHT` table, which contains the details of flights.
- **JOINs**: Necessary to connect the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table for both departure and arrival airports, as well as the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables for pricing information.
- **WHERE**: Filter results to only include flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore in economy class.

Make sure to replace the `AIRPORT_NAME` values with the appropriate airport code or names based on your database entries if they differ. Also, check the `CLASS_TYPE` in the `FARE_BASIS` table for the exact representation used in your DB schema for 'economy'.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the economy flights from Las Vegas to Baltimore, we first need to make assumptions about the airport codes for Las Vegas (LAS) and Baltimore (BWI). Additionally, we'll need to join several tables to gather information about the flights, the fare details, and the associated classes of service.

Here's a SQL query that finds economy flights available from Las Vegas to Baltimore:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    FLIGHT_F.FARE_ID,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FLIGHT_F ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_F.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FARE ON FLIGHT_F.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE C ON FB.BOOKING_CLASS = C.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS'  -- Las Vegas airport code
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI' -- Baltimore airport code
    AND C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Economy'; -- Filter for economy class
```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Table Joins**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `FLIGHT_FARE` to link the flights to their respective fares.
   - The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is then joined to the `FARE` table to get fare details.
   - The `FARE` table is joined with `FARE_BASIS` to get the fare basis details, and this further joins with `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` to filter for economy class flights.

2. **Filters**:
   - `F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS'` filters results for flights departing from Las Vegas.
   - `F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BWI'` filters for flights arriving in Baltimore.
   - `C.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Economy'` ensures that only economy class flights are returned.

Make sure to substitute the airport codes as needed if they are different in your dataset. This query assumes standard airport codes based on common conventions.

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query that retrieves the relevant information and fare details for an economy class flight from Baltimore to Kansas City, we will first need to establish the airport codes for both locations, retrieve the economy fare options, and then link all this information together.

Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Assuming the airport codes for Baltimore and Kansas City are known and represented as 'BWI' and 'MCI'.
-- Please replace 'BWI' and 'MCI' with the actual airport codes if different.

SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    cs.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE cs ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = cs.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BWI' -- Baltimore Airport Code
AND 
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCI'   -- Kansas City Airport Code
AND 
    cs.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Economy';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: This part of the query specifies the columns that we want to retrieve, including flight number, airline name, departure and arrival times, and fare information.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: We start from the `FLIGHT` table as the base table since we're interested in flight information.
  
3. **JOINs**: 
   - We join the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names associated with each flight.
   - We join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` to get the fare details associated with each flight.
   - We join `FARE_BASIS` and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` to filter for the economy class fares.
  
4. **WHERE Clause**: This section filters the results to show only flights from Baltimore to Kansas City, specifically looking for economy class.

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport codes ('BWI' for Baltimore and 'MCI' for Kansas City in this example) are accurate as per your database schema.
- The query assumes that the economy class is defined in your `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table with a `CLASS_DESCRIPTION` of 'Economy'. Adjust this if the naming is different in your database schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
-- Assuming the airport codes for Baltimore and Kansas City are known and represented as 'BWI' and 'MCI'.
-- Please replace 'BWI' and 'MCI' with the actual airport codes if different.

Question: what types of ground transportation are available in DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out what types of ground transportation are available in Denver, you would typically need to join the relevant tables that contain information about cities, airports, and ground services. Specifically, you would want to look at the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, and `GROUND_SERVICE` tables.

Assuming that the city code for Denver is known or can be derived, the following SQL query can be used:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'DENVER';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Distinct Transport Types**: The query selects distinct transportation types from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table to avoid duplicates.
2. **Table Joins**: 
   - The `GROUND_SERVICE` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table to correlate ground services with specific airports.
   - The `AIRPORT` table is then joined with the `CITY` table to filter services based on the city name "DENVER".
3. **City Filter**: The `WHERE` clause restricts the results to those associated with Denver.

Make sure you replace 'DENVER' with the corresponding term used in your database schema if it differs (e.g., all caps, abbreviations, etc.).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE

Question: is ground transportation available in ST. LOUIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To check if ground transportation is available in St. Louis, you should first identify the appropriate city code for St. Louis and then query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table to see if any transportation types are available for that city. 

Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

1. Get the city code for St. Louis from the `CITY` table.
2. Use that city code to check the `GROUND_SERVICE` table for available transportation options.

Here’s the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN 
    CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS';
```

This query will return the types of ground transportation available in St. Louis, if any. If the result set is empty, it means that there are no ground transportation options available in St. Louis.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN 
    CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS';

Question: ground transportation in LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about ground transportation in Las Vegas from the given database schema, we will need to join relevant tables. Specifically, we will look for services provided by the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, using `CITY_CODE` and `AIRPORT_CODE` that refer to Las Vegas.

Here's an example SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    G.CITY_CODE,
    C.CITY_NAME,
    C.STATE_CODE,
    C.COUNTRY_NAME,
    A.AIRPORT_NAME,
    GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS
JOIN 
    CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'Las Vegas';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT**: This part selects the fields we want in the result, including city details and ground transportation information.
- **FROM GROUND_SERVICE GS**: We start from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, giving it the alias `GS` for easier reference.
- **JOIN CITY C ON GS.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE**: We join the `CITY` table to get the city details, using `CITY_CODE` as the linking key.
- **JOIN AIRPORT A ON GS.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE**: We also join the `AIRPORT` table to get details of the airport(s) in Las Vegas.
- **WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Las Vegas'**: This filter ensures we only get records where the city is Las Vegas.

This query will return information about the different types of ground transportation available in Las Vegas along with their corresponding fares.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    G.CITY_CODE,
    C.CITY_NAME,
    C.STATE_CODE,

Question: ground transportation for LAS VEGAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about ground transportation services available for Las Vegas, you would typically select data from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table that corresponds to the city code for Las Vegas. However, since we don’t have a direct mapping in the provided schema (such as `CITY_CODE` for Las Vegas), we need to first find the city code.

Assuming Las Vegas corresponds to a specific value for `CITY_CODE`, you might need a query that first finds this city code. Let’s assume that the `CITY_CODE` for Las Vegas is known. Here's how you can write the SQL query.

### SQL Query to Find Ground Transportation Services for Las Vegas:

```sql
SELECT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = 'LAS_VEGAS_CITY_CODE'; -- replace with actual CITY_CODE for Las Vegas
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT**: This selects the type of ground transportation and the fare, along with the name and location of the airport.
- **FROM**: This specifies the primary table from which to retrieve data, which is `GROUND_SERVICE`.
- **JOIN**: This joins the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get additional details about the airports.
- **WHERE**: This filters the results to only include ground transportation services related to Las Vegas. You need to replace `'LAS_VEGAS_CITY_CODE'` with the actual city code for Las Vegas from the `CITY` table.

If you need to find out the actual `CITY_CODE` for Las Vegas, you might need an additional query like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    CITY_CODE 
FROM 
    CITY 
WHERE 
    CITY_NAME = 'Las Vegas';
```

You can then use the resulting `CITY_CODE` in the previous query.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    GROUND_SERVICE.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    GROUND_SERVICE.GROUND_FARE,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION

    GROUND_SERVICE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT ON GROUND_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    GROUND_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = 'LAS_VEGAS_CITY_CODE'; -- replace with actual CITY_CODE for Las Vegas

Question: what ground transportation is there in BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the ground transportation options available in Baltimore from the given database schema, you need to utilize the `GROUND_SERVICE` table. This table contains information about the transportation types and related fares, and it references city and airport codes.

First, you'll need to identify the `CITY_CODE` associated with Baltimore. You can subsequently query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table using this `CITY_CODE` to find the relevant ground transportation options. 

Here's the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    GS.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    GS.GROUND_FARE
FROM 
    CITY C
JOIN 
    GROUND_SERVICE GS ON C.CITY_CODE = GS.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE';
```

This query performs the following actions:
1. Selects the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
2. Joins the `CITY` table on the `CITY_CODE` to filter the records for Baltimore.
3. Filters for records where the `CITY_NAME` is 'BALTIMORE'.

Make sure your database contains the relevant records, as the output will only be based on existing data for ground transportation services associated with Baltimore.

Question: list ground transportation in BALTIMORE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the ground transportation options available in Baltimore, you will need to join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables to filter by the location of Baltimore. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    G.GROUND_FARE,
    A.AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN 
    CITY C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON G.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'BALTIMORE';
```

This query will return the types of ground transportation available along with their associated fares at the airports serving Baltimore.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE,
    G.GROUND_FARE,
    A.AIRPORT_NAME

Question: is there ground transportation available at the DENVER airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is ground transportation available at the Denver airport, we first need to identify the airport code for Denver in the AIRPORT table. Once we have the Denver airport code, we can check the GROUND_SERVICE table to see if there are any entries associated with that airport. 

Assuming the airport code for Denver is `DEN`, the SQL query to check for ground transportation would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    gs.GROUND_FARE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON gs.AIRPORT_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver';
```

This query selects the transport types and their corresponding ground fares for any services available at the Denver airport by joining the GROUND_SERVICE table with the AIRPORT table based on the airport code. 

Make sure to replace `'Denver'` with the exact name used in your AIRPORT table if it's different.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    gs.GROUND_FARE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs 
JOIN

WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Denver';

Question: tell me about the ground transportation from NASHVILLE airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NASHVILLE" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about the ground transportation services available from Nashville Airport (with the airport code likely being something like "BNA" for Nashville International Airport), you would need to join relevant tables from the schema that deal with ground services and airport information. Here's an SQL query that demonstrates how to fetch that information:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME, 
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    G.GROUND_FARE, 
    C.CITY_NAME
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS A
JOIN 
    GROUND_SERVICE AS G ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = G.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Nashville International Airport';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve which includes the airport name, type of ground transportation, fare for ground transportation, and city name.
- **FROM AIRPORT AS A**: Targets the `AIRPORT` table and gives it an alias `A`.
- **JOIN GROUND_SERVICE AS G ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = G.AIRPORT_CODE**: Joins the `GROUND_SERVICE` table to the `AIRPORT` table on the airport code to get ground transportation data specific to Nashville Airport.
- **JOIN CITY AS C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE**: Joins the `CITY` table to get the city name associated with the ground transportation services.
- **WHERE A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Nashville International Airport'**: Filters the results to only include services that relate to Nashville International Airport.

You may need to adjust the `WHERE` clause depending on the exact airport code or name in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME, 
    G.TRANSPORT_TYPE,

Question: what type of ground transportation is there at the LAS VEGAS airport
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 , GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE = CITYalias0.CITY_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the type of ground transportation available at the Las Vegas airport using your database schema, you can execute an SQL query that joins the necessary tables. Specifically, you will need to use the `GROUND_SERVICE` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for the Las Vegas airport.

Assuming the airport code for Las Vegas is "LAS" (which it generally is), the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT G.TRANSPORT_TYPE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN AIRPORT A ON G.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS';
```

This query selects the types of transportation from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table where the `AIRPORT_NAME` is 'LAS VEGAS'. Make sure to adjust the `WHERE` clause if the specific name stored in the database differs.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT G.TRANSPORT_TYPE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN AIRPORT A ON G.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE A.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS';

To find the cheapest one-way flights from Montreal (likely represented by its airport code) to Orlando (also represented by its airport code), you need to join several tables in the database schema. Assuming you know the airport codes for Montreal (YUL) and Orlando (MCO), the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YUL' 
    AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO' 
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'
ORDER BY 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;  -- Retrieves only the cheapest one-way flight
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- We're selecting the flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and the one-way cost.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the names of the airlines.
- We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` table with the `FARE` table to get the costs associated with the flight.
- The `WHERE` clause filters to only include flights from Montreal (YUL) to Orlando (MCO) that are one-way.
- Finally, we order the results by cost in ascending order and use `LIMIT 1` to get the cheapest flight.

Make sure to replace 'YUL' and 'MCO' with the actual airport codes if they differ.

To find the cheapest one-way flights from Orlando to Montreal using the provided database schema, you would typically need to join several tables to get all necessary flight information as well as fare details. Below is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.STOPS, 
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MONTREAL' AND 
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'
ORDER BY 
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves relevant flight information including airline code, flight number, departure/arrival times, source/destination airports, number of stops, and the one-direction cost.
2. **FROM and JOINs**:
   - **FLIGHT F**: The main table, representing flight details.
   - **FARE FA**: Joined on the flight ID to get the fare details related to each flight.
   - **AIRPORT A1 and A2**: Two joins to map the FROM and TO airports to their respective names to allow filtering.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to include only flights from Orlando to Montreal and ensures it's a one-way flight (by checking `FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`).
4. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by the one-direction cost in ascending order to get the cheapest flight first.
5. **LIMIT 1**: Limits the result to only one flight, which is the cheapest.

Make sure that you have the correct names and codes for the airports in your database for the query to work as intended. Adjust the airport names if they are stored differently (e.g., using airport codes).

To find nonstop flights from Montreal to Orlando, you'll need to query the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to identify the airports and link the necessary information. Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MONTREAL' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    F.STOPS = 0;  -- This ensures only nonstop flights are returned
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHT`: The main table that has the flight details.
- `AIRPORT`: Joined twice, once for the departure airport (Montreal) and once for the arrival airport (Orlando).
- Criteria:
  - The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from Montreal (identified by its airport code) and arriving in Orlando.
  - The `F.STOPS = 0` condition filters the results to include only nonstop flights. 

Make sure to replace the specific conditions based on the actual airport codes or names as relevant to your data if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from St. Petersburg to Toronto, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you'll query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights that have no stops between the two cities. 

We will need to get the airport codes for St. Petersburg and Toronto from the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables. Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PETERSBURG' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' AND
    F.STOPS = 0;  -- Nonstop flights
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **SELECT**: We are selecting flight details, including flight number, airline code, departure airport name, arrival airport name, departure time, and arrival time.
   
2. **FROM FLIGHT F**: We're querying the `FLIGHT` table.

3. **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (`A1`) and once for the arrival airport (`A2`).

4. **JOIN CITY**: We join the `CITY` table twice to filter out the correct cities (St. Petersburg for departure and Toronto for arrival).

5. **WHERE**: We filter the results to only include flights that depart from St. Petersburg and arrive in Toronto, along with checking that there are 0 stops (i.e., nonstop flights).

Make sure to review the actual airport names/codes in your database, as this SQL query assumes that they match the case and spelling of common airport names. Adjust `CITY_NAME` matches based on how they are stored (e.g., the full name or abbreviation).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Toronto to St. Petersburg using the provided database schema, you would typically need to filter records from the `FLIGHT` table by defining the departure and arrival airports based on their respective airport codes. Assuming you know the airport codes for Toronto and St. Petersburg, the query could look as follows:

Let’s say the airport code for Toronto is `YYZ` and for St. Petersburg is `LED` (please replace these codes with the correct ones if they differ in your database).

Here’s an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%TORONTO%' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%ST. PETERSBURG%' AND 
    F.STOPS = 0;  -- Ensuring that the flight is nonstop
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant flight details (flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, airports, etc.) from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We use `JOIN` to combine relevant information from the `AIRPORT` table to get the full names of the departure and arrival locations.
- We filter the results based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` corresponding to Toronto and the `TO_AIRPORT` corresponding to St. Petersburg.
- The condition `F.STOPS = 0` ensures that we only retrieve nonstop flights. 

Make sure to verify and replace the airport names and codes with those present in your database, as well as adjust the `LIKE` conditions if necessary based on how the names are stored in your `AIRPORT` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Toronto to St. Petersburg, you would need to join several tables, particularly the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables. You'll look for flights where the departing airport is Toronto and the arriving airport is St. Petersburg, and make sure that the number of stops is zero (indicating nonstop).

Assuming the airport codes for Toronto and St. Petersburg are known, let's assume they are `YYZ` for Toronto and `LED` for St. Petersburg for the sake of this SQL query. Here’s how you might write the SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'YYZ' -- Toronto
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LED' -- St. Petersburg
    AND f.STOPS = 0; -- Nonstop flights
```

In this SQL query:

- We're selecting relevant columns including the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both departure and arrival airports.
- We filter the results based on the airport codes and ensure that `STOPS` is 0 for nonstop flights. 

Make sure to replace `'YYZ'` and `'LED'` with the actual airport codes if they're different in your database.

Question: give me the flights from NEW YORK to LAS VEGAS nonstop
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from New York to Las Vegas, you would need to query the `FLIGHT` table, filtering for flights with the origin (`FROM_AIRPORT`) set to New York and the destination (`TO_AIRPORT`) set to Las Vegas, while also ensuring that the number of stops (`STOPS`) is zero. 

Here's a sample SQL query that assumes you have the appropriate airport codes for New York and Las Vegas. For this example, let’s say the airport code for New York is "JFK" (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and for Las Vegas is "LAS" (McCarran International Airport):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAS' 
    AND F.STOPS = 0;
```

This query selects various columns from the `FLIGHT` table for nonstop flights from JFK to LAS. Make sure to adjust the airport codes as necessary based on the actual codes in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Memphis to Las Vegas, you can join several tables in the database schema provided. You would primarily need to look at the `FLIGHT` table for the flights and the `AIRPORT` table to ensure you are filtering on the proper airport codes for Memphis and Las Vegas. Nonstop flights can be identified by checking that the number of stops (`STOPS`) is 0.

Here's an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS' 
    AND f.STOPS = 0;
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant fields from the `FLIGHT` table as well as join with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- We specify the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` to ensure they're for Memphis and Las Vegas, respectively.
- The condition `f.STOPS = 0` ensures that we only get nonstop flights.

Question: what are the nonstop flights between HOUSTON and MEMPHIS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the nonstop flights between Houston and Memphis from the given database schema, you will need to join several tables. The primary tables of interest here are the FLIGHT table, which contains information about the flights and their route, and the AIRPORT table, which can provide the airport codes for Houston and Memphis.

Assuming "HOUSTON" refers to airports like George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), and "MEMPHIS" refers to Memphis International Airport (MEM), the following SQL query can be used to retrieve nonstop flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%HOUSTON%'
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%MEMPHIS%'
    AND F.STOPS = 0;  -- Ensure we only get nonstop flights
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Choose the columns to display, which include the flight number, airline code, and departure/arrival times.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: Start with the FLIGHT table as the primary table.
- **JOIN AIRPORT**: Join the AIRPORT table twice, once for the departure airport (A_FROM) and once for the arrival airport (A_TO).
- **WHERE**: Filter the results to include only flights departing from any airport in Houston and arriving at any airport in Memphis. The `F.STOPS = 0` condition ensures that we only get nonstop flights.
- **LIKE**: The use of the LIKE operator is to match any airport whose name contains "HOUSTON" or "MEMPHIS" in order to accommodate any airport that may fit that description. 

You may need to adjust the `LIKE` conditions to specifically match the airport names as per your database's actual entries, particularly if there are multiple airports or variations. If you are certain about the specific airport codes, you could directly use equal matches instead.

Question: COLUMBUS to CHICAGO one way before 1000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( ( FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "COLUMBUS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Columbus to Chicago for a one-way trip that are priced under $1,000, you would need to perform a SQL query that joins the relevant tables and applies the specified conditions. You will likely want to join the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY` tables.

Here's an example SQL query based on your schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a_dep.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_arr.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_dep ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_dep.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_arr ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_arr.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_dep.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Columbus' AND 
    a_arr.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Chicago' AND 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST < 1000;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve (flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, fare cost, departure and arrival times).
  
- **FROM**: Indicates the primary table for the flight data which is `FLIGHT`.

- **JOIN**: They link other necessary tables to get full information:
  - Joining `AIRPORT` to retrieve airport names for both departure and arrival.
  - Joining `FLIGHT_FARE` to link the flight with its corresponding fare details.
  
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to include only:
  - Flights departing from Columbus (`a_dep.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Columbus'`)
  - Flights arriving in Chicago (`a_arr.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Chicago'`)
  - Flights with a cost less than $1,000 (`fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST < 1000`)

Make sure to verify the specific names of the airports in the `AIRPORT` table that relate to Columbus and Chicago, as you may need to use their respective airport codes or another descriptor if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Indianapolis to Memphis that depart before 10:00 AM on any day, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fa.FARE_ID   -- Assuming FARE_ID is used to link to FLIGHT
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'INDIANAPOLIS' AND
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < '10:00:00' AND
    f.STOPS = 0;  -- Optional: include this line if you want to filter out connecting flights
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects flight details, including the flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline name, and fare.
- Joins are made between the FLIGHT table and AIRLINE and FARE tables to get additional information.
- It filters results where the departure airport is 'INDIANAPOLIS', the arrival airport is 'MEMPHIS', and the departure time is before 10:00 AM. 
- If you want to specifically filter for one-way flights (no stops), the condition `f.STOPS = 0` can be included, assuming that the STOPS column indicates the number of connections (0 meaning a direct flight). If the FLIGHT table does not include a direct way of indicating one-way flights, you can simply omit that line. 

Make sure that the values for the airports are correctly defined in your database, as they might be referred to by airport codes rather than names. Adjust the WHERE clause accordingly if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Cleveland to Dallas that depart before 12:00 PM, you would typically join several tables from the provided schema, including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `CITY`. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'DALLAS' 
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to output (flight number, departure and arrival airport names, departure and arrival times, airline code).
- **FROM**: Indicates the main table, which is `FLIGHT`.
- **JOIN**: This is used to link the `AIRPORT` table for both the departure and arrival airports to get their names. It also links to the `CITY` table to get the specific cities.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights where:
  - The departure city is Cleveland.
  - The arrival city is Dallas.
  - The departure time is before 12:00 PM.

Make sure to adjust your database to support the time format used in the query if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 9:00 AM, you need to consider the relevant tables, specifically the `FLIGHT` and `AIRPORT` tables to find the appropriate flights based on the departure airport and time.

Here's the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE

    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TAMPA' AND 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 9;
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

- **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns to retrieve, including flight number, airline code, departure time, and the originating and destination airports.
  
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: Indicates that we're primarily retrieving information from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains the flight details.
  
- **JOIN AIRPORT A1**: We're joining the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport and once for the destination airport. A1 corresponds to Cincinnati and A2 to Tampa.
  
- **WHERE**: This clause filters the results to ensure that:
  - The flight originates from Cincinnati.
  - The flight is headed to Tampa.
  - The departure time is before 9:00 AM (using `EXTRACT` to get the hour from the `DEPARTURE_TIME`).

Make sure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in a format that allows the hour to be extracted correctly (like a `TIME` or `DATETIME` type). Adjust the query as needed based on your specific database implementation.

Question: list flights from CINCINNATI to TAMPA before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Cincinnati to Tampa that depart before 12:00 PM, we will need to join several tables based on their relevant fields. Based on the database schema provided, we can identify the required tables and fields for this query. We'll focus on the `FLIGHT` table for flight details (departure and destination), and we'll use a `CITY` table to find the airport codes for Cincinnati and Tampa. Below is the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'TAMPA' AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12
ORDER BY
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT Statement**: We're selecting the fields we want to see in the result: `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, and names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **JOINs**:
   - Joining `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` (twice) to get the airport names for the departure and arrival locations.
   - Joining `CITY` to filter based on the city names for Cincinnati and Tampa.

3. **WHERE Clause**: Filtering for flights that:
   - Depart from Cincinnati and arrive in Tampa.
   - Depart before 12:00 PM using the `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12` condition.

4. **ORDER BY**: The results are ordered by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` for easier readability.

**Note**: The handling of time (in the WHERE clause) assumes that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in a format that allows us to directly extract the hour. Depending on the actual data type, you may need to adjust the syntax accordingly.

Question: HOUSTON to DALLAS before 0
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Houston to Dallas that depart before 00:00 (midnight), you will need to write a SQL query that joins relevant tables and applies the necessary filters.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'HOUSTON' AND
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DALLAS' AND
    TIME_TO_SEC(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < TIME_TO_SEC('00:00:00');
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: This selects relevant columns: flight number, departure time, airline code, airline name, from airport, and to airport.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the primary table, `FLIGHT`, to query flight information.
3. **JOIN Clause**: Joins the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name based on the airline code in the `FLIGHT` table.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to flights departing from "HOUSTON" to "DALLAS" and departs before midnight (00:00). `TIME_TO_SEC` is used to convert time to seconds for easier comparison.

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport codes for "HOUSTON" and "DALLAS" are stored correctly in the database. If the airport representation might be different, you might need to adjust the query to use correct airport codes or matching logic.
- If you want to retrieve all flight details including any connection information, you may need to join additional tables such as `FLIGHT_STOP`, depending on how detailed you want the output to be.

Question: list the flights from INDIANAPOLIS to MEMPHIS that leave before 1200
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "INDIANAPOLIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Indianapolis to Memphis that leave before 12:00 PM (noon), you'll need to identify the relevant airports for Indianapolis and Memphis, then filter the flights according to the specified departure time. Here’s how you can write the SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE, 
       FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT, 
       FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT 
FROM FLIGHT 
JOIN AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE 
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Indianapolis' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Memphis' 
  AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We are joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport).
- We filter the results where the departure airport is "Indianapolis" and the arrival airport is "Memphis."
- Finally, we filter the departure time to only include flights that leave before 12:00 PM. 

Ensure that the airport names in the `WHERE` clause match exactly with those in the airport table. You may need to adjust the names according to the data in your actual database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about the types of aircraft flying from Cleveland to Dallas before 12:00 (noon), you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes the relevant tables are properly joined based on their relationships.

Here's a SQL query that targets this specific information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, a.AIRCRAFT_CODE, a.MANUFACTURER, a.BASIC_TYPE
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = a.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'Cleveland' 
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'Dallas' 
  AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. `SELECT DISTINCT`: Fetches unique aircraft descriptions.
2. `a.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, a.AIRCRAFT_CODE, a.MANUFACTURER, a.BASIC_TYPE`: Selects specific columns from the AIRCRAFT table to provide aircraft details.
3. `FROM FLIGHT f`: Indicates that the main source of data is the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as f).
4. `JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = a.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`: Joins the `FLIGHT` table to the `AIRCRAFT` table based on the common field `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`.
5. `WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'Cleveland'`: Filters records to only those departing from Cleveland.
6. `AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'Dallas'`: Filters records to only those arriving in Dallas.
7. `AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'`: Adds the condition to select flights that depart before 12:00 noon.

Make sure to adjust the query accordingly if your airport codes or names are in different formats or case-sensitive, and ensure that the time format matches your database's time format.

Question: tell me again the morning flights on AA from PHILADELPHIA to DALLAS
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PHILADELPHIA" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the morning flights on American Airlines (AA) from Philadelphia to Dallas, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that "morning flights" refers to flights departing between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A.AIRLINE_NAME AS AIRLINE,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PHILADELPHIA' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'DALLAS'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 5
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause retrieves flight details like flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline name, and airport codes.
- The `JOIN` clause combines the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name.
- The `WHERE` clause filters:
  - Only American Airlines flights (using `A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'`).
  - Only flights from Philadelphia to Dallas.
  - Morning flights by checking the hour of the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
- The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` to show the flights in chronological order.

Make sure the actual values for `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` conform with your database entries (e.g., if they are coded as airport codes, use the appropriate airport codes for Philadelphia and Dallas).

Question: what is the earliest arriving flight from BOSTON to WASHINGTON DC
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias2.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias2 WHERE CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias3.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias3 WHERE ( CITYalias3.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias3.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME = ( SELECT MIN( FLIGHTalias1.ARRIVAL_TIME ) FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight from Boston to Washington, DC, you will typically need to join several tables to gather all the required information such as the flight details and the corresponding airports. Assuming that you know the airport codes for Boston (BOS) and Washington DC (DCA or IAD), here’s how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BOS' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT IN ('DCA', 'IAD')
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: This part selects relevant columns that you might want to see in the output, including flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and airport codes.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table from which to retrieve the flight data.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights going from Boston (BOS) to Washington DC (which could be either DCA or IAD).
4. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME` in ascending order, so the earliest arriving flight is at the top.
5. **LIMIT 1**: Restricts the output to only one record, effectively giving you the earliest arriving flight.

Make sure to replace 'BOS', 'DCA', and 'IAD' with the actual airport codes if they differ in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight between Boston and Washington DC, you'll need to query the relevant tables in the database schema provided. Assuming you have the airport codes for Boston and Washington DC, here is a typical SQL query you can use:

1. Find the airport codes for Boston and Washington DC from the `AIRPORT` table.
2. Join the `FLIGHT` table with the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to filter out flights between these two airports.
3. Order the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME` to find the earliest flight.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON DC'
ORDER BY
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight details such as the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Boston) and once for the arrival airport (Washington DC).
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights from Boston to Washington DC.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results based on the arrival time in ascending order.
- The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the earliest arriving flight is returned. 

Make sure to replace the airport names if the exact names in the database differ. If you have the airport codes for Boston and Washington DC instead, you can directly use those codes in the `WHERE` clause to simplify the query.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight between Boston and Washington DC, you will need to extract information from the relevant tables, primarily focusing on the `FLIGHT` and `AIRPORT` tables. You will need to perform a join to match the airports for Boston and Washington DC and filter the flights based on their arrival times.

Here is an SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'WASHINGTON DC'
ORDER BY 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We're selecting the flight number, airline code, arrival time, departure time, and the names of the departure (BOSTON) and arrival (WASHINGTON DC) airports.
- **FROM**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, representing details about all the flights.
- **JOIN**: 
   - `a_from` is joined to get the departure airport details (where the name is BOSTON).
   - `a_to` is joined to get the arrival airport details (where the name is WASHINGTON DC).
- **WHERE**: We filter to only include flights departing from BOSTON and arriving at WASHINGTON DC.
- **ORDER BY**: We order the results by the arrival time in ascending order.
- **LIMIT 1**: This returns only the earliest arriving flight.

Make sure that the actual airport codes for Boston and Washington DC are used in the `AIRPORT` table to ensure accurate results since the names might have variations.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the earliest arriving flight from Houston to Orlando, you can use the `FLIGHT` table along with `AIRPORT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables. You would need to join these tables based on the airport codes and filter for flights that match the specified departure and arrival cities.

Here is an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID, f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, f.AIRLINE_CODE, f.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'HOUSTON' AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
ORDER BY f.ARRIVAL_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns such as `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME`.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to filter on both the departure airport (Houston) and the arrival airport (Orlando).
- The `WHERE` clause specifies that we are interested only in flights that depart from Houston and arrive in Orlando.
- It orders the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME` in ascending order to get the earliest arrival and uses `LIMIT 1` to return only the first result.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the earliest arriving flight from Houston to Orlando, we'll need to determine the relevant airport codes for both cities first. Assuming the code for Houston is 'IAH' (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) or 'HOU' (William P. Hobby Airport), and the code for Orlando is 'MCO' (Orlando International Airport), we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE IN ('IAH', 'HOU') AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MCO'
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting the relevant fields**: We select the flight ID, flight number, arrival time, departure time, and names of the originating and destination airports, as well as the airline information.

2. **Joining tables**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice. The first join gets the airport information for the departure airport (Houston), and the second join gets the airport information for the arrival airport (Orlando).

3. **Filtering**: We filter the results to only include flights from either 'IAH' or 'HOU' to 'MCO'.

4. **Sorting and limiting results**: We sort the flights by Arrival Time in ascending order and use `LIMIT 1` to get only the earliest flight.

Please adjust the airport codes if they are different in your database.

Question: what are the fares for flights between BOSTON and WASHINGTON
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BOSTON" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE = "DC" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query the fares for flights between Boston and Washington from your database schema, we need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `CITY` to ensure we're correctly identifying flights from and to the respective airports in each city.

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FAROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE AS FA ON FA.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FA.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'BOSTON' AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Required Fields**: We're retrieving flight numbers, airport names for the departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, along with the one-way and round-trip fares.
   
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (Boston) and once for the arrival airport (Washington).
   - We join the `FARE` table to get fare information corresponding to the departure and arrival airports.
   - We use the `CITY` table to ensure we're accurately filtering the results to only include flights where one city is Boston and the other is Washington.

3. **Where Clause**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to show only flights where the departure city is Boston and the arrival city is Washington.

Make sure that Boston and Washington have corresponding entries in the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables. If airport codes vary or additional criteria exist (like specific fare conditions), you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

Question: what is TPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "TPA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
Based on the provided database schema, "TPA" appears to be an abbreviation or acronym that is not explicitly defined in any table listed. It's possible that "TPA" could stand for a city, airport, service, or any other entity relevant to the context of airlines or travel, but there is no direct reference to "TPA" in the schema you've shared.

To find out what "TPA" represents, you might want to check if it's a city code, airport code, or any other relevant entity in your database. If you're looking for specific details in the schema, you would typically examine the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, or perhaps `FLIGHT` tables, as they are most likely to hold relevant entries.

Here's an example of how you might write a SQL query to check if "TPA" corresponds to an airport code or city code:

1. **Check in the AIRPORT table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'TPA';
   ```

2. **Check in the CITY table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE CITY_CODE = 'TPA';
   ```

3. **If "TPA" may also be a part of the `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, or other tables and related entries might exist, you can explore those too.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'TPA';
   SELECT * FROM FLIGHT WHERE FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'TPA';
   ```

Please run these queries against your database to find out what "TPA" specifically refers to in your context.

Here's an example of how you might write a SQL query to check if "TPA" corresponds to an airport code or city code:

1. **Check in the AIRPORT table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_CODE = 'TPA';
   ```

2. **Check in the CITY table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE CITY_CODE = 'TPA';
   ```

3. **If "TPA" may also be a part of the `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, or other tables and related entries might exist, you can explore those too.**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM AIRLINE WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'TPA';
   SELECT * FROM FLIGHT WHERE FLIGHT_NUMBER = 'TPA';
   ```

Please run these queries against your database to find out what "TPA" specifically refers to in your context.

Question: i need a DAILY flight from ST. LOUIS to MILWAUKEE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve daily flights from St. Louis to Milwaukee using the provided database schema, you'll need to join several tables to get all the necessary information. You will focus on the `FLIGHT` table, which holds the flight details, as well as the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables to identify the correct airport codes for St. Louis and Milwaukee.

Here is a SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    c1.CITY_NAME AS FROM_CITY,
    c2.CITY_NAME AS TO_CITY
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%1%'  -- Assuming 1 represents a daily frequency, adjust as needed for the specific implementation. 
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting relevant columns such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and names of the airports and cities.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to match the flight's origins and destinations.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to flights departing from St. Louis and arriving in Milwaukee.
- The `%1%` in `f.FLIGHT_DAYS` is a generic example that you could replace according to the actual representation of daily flights in your data. Ensure that the condition matches how daily flights are represented in your `FLIGHT` table.
- The results are ordered by departure time.

Ensure you adjust the query as necessary depending on the specific needs and schema nuances.

Question: show me flights from MILWAUKEE to ORLANDO one way
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ORLANDO" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = "NO" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MILWAUKEE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando, you would need to use a SQL query that joins multiple tables to gather all the necessary information about flights, including their fare details. Here's an example SQL query for that:

```sql
SELECT 
    FFL.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.CREW,
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS,
    F.CONNECTING_FLIGHT
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE AS A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'ORLANDO'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS IS NOT NULL  -- Ensuring there are days defined for the flight.
    AND F.STOPS = 0; -- Assuming we are looking for direct flights.
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Fields**: The query selects relevant fields from the `FLIGHT` table, and optionally, from the `AIRLINE` table to include the airline name.
- **Joining Tables**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name associated with each flight.
- **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters for flights departing from Milwaukee (assuming the abbreviation for Milwaukee is represented as a code in the database) and arriving in Orlando (similarly assuming the code for Orlando).
- **Direct Flights**: The query looks for flights with no stops to ensure we get one-way, direct flights.

### Note:
- Ensure that the airport codes for Milwaukee and Orlando are accurate in your database (the actual values might be different).
- Modify the salary fields in the `SELECT` clause as needed based on the available data and what details are required. Adjust filters for return trips if needed (in this query context, it's focused on one-way trips).

Question: list flights from TAMPA to CINCINNATI after 1500
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Tampa to Cincinnati after 1500 (3:00 PM), you will need to join the relevant tables and apply the necessary filters. Below is an example SQL query that demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Tampa' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Cincinnati' 
    AND CAST(F.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) > '15:00:00';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be returned, such as airline code, flight number, departure time, arrival time, etc.
2. **FROM FLIGHT**: Specifies the main table, which is `FLIGHT`, containing flight information.
3. **JOIN AIRPORT**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table for both the departure (Tampa) and arrival (Cincinnati) airports.
4. **WHERE**: Applies the filters to select only flights from Tampa to Cincinnati that depart after 1500 (3:00 PM) using the `CAST` function to convert `DEPARTURE_TIME` into a format that can be compared against the time string.

Ensure that the actual names of the airport entries ('Tampa' and 'Cincinnati') match the records in your `AIRPORT` table. If they are identified by specific airport codes, you should replace the airport names with their respective codes.

Question: DALLAS to HOUSTON after 1201am
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from Dallas to Houston after 12:01 AM, you will need to join several tables that contain relevant information about the flights, airports, and cities. The SQL query below assumes that you have the necessary relationships set up between the tables based on the provided schema.

Here's an SQL query that selects the relevant flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'DAL' -- Assuming 'DAL' is the CITY_CODE for Dallas
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'HOU' -- Assuming 'HOU' is the CITY_CODE for Houston
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '00:01:00' -- Time in HH:MM:SS format
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

**Note:**
1. Replace `'DAL'` and `'HOU'` with the actual `CITY_CODE`s for Dallas and Houston if these are different in your database.
2. The time format used in the `WHERE` clause for `DEPARTURE_TIME` may need to be adjusted depending on how it is stored in your database (e.g. as `TIME`, `DATETIME`, etc.).
3. The exact queries may need to be customized depending upon the actual data types and relationships you are working with in your database schema.

Question: what cities does NW fly out of
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out which cities Northwest Airlines (identified by the airline code 'NW') flies out of, you would typically need to join several tables. In this case, you want to find all the cities associated with the flights operated by 'NW'. This involves joining the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_LEG`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `CITY` tables.

Here is an SQL query to retrieve the desired information:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT ap ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = ap.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY c ON ap.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

### Explanation:
1. **JOIN the tables:** The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_LEG` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables based on the `FLIGHT_ID` to find specific flights and their legs/stops.
2. **Get the airport info:** The `FROM_AIRPORT` from the `FLIGHT` table is then linked to the `AIRPORT` table to get the related `CITY_CODE`.
3. **Retrieve City Names:** Finally, the `CITY` table is joined to get the `CITY_NAME` corresponding to the `CITY_CODE` from the `AIRPORT` table.
4. **Filtering by airline:** The `WHERE clause filters the results to only include flights operated by Northwest Airlines (NW). 
5. **DISTINCT clause:** This ensures that each city is listed only once, even if there are multiple flights from that city.

Make sure to run the query in the appropriate SQL environment that supports your database schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT c.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN FLIGHT_LEG fl ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID

JOIN CITY c ON ap.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';

Question: list the cities from which NW flies
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the cities from which Northwest Airlines (NW) operates flights, you need to join the relevant tables. We will primarily need the `FLIGHT` table to find flights operated by NW, and the `CITY` table to get the associated city names. We will also use the `AIRPORT` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables to link cities to the airports.

Here's an SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.CITY_NAME 
FROM CITY c
JOIN AIRPORT a ON c.CITY_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE asrv ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = asrv.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN FLIGHT f ON asrv.CITY_CODE = f.FROM_AIRPORT 
WHERE f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

In this query:
- We select distinct city names from the `CITY` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table to link cities to airports.
- We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to make sure we are only considering those services.
- Finally, we filter by the airline code 'NW' to get only the flights operated by Northwest Airlines. 

Ensure that you adjust the query accordingly if there are any specific database relationships or naming conventions differing from the defined schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT c.CITY_NAME 
FROM CITY c
JOIN AIRPORT a ON c.CITY_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE asrv ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = asrv.AIRPORT_CODE

Question: what cities does NW fly to
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out what cities Northwest Airlines (indicated by the airline code "NW") flies to, you would need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_LEG`, and `CITY`. The specific SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY.CITY_NAME
FROM FLIGHT
JOIN AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN FLIGHT_LEG ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_LEG.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ON AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY ON AIRPORT_SERVICE.CITY_CODE = CITY.CITY_CODE
WHERE AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

This query selects all the unique city names from the `CITY` table that are associated with flights operated by Northwest Airlines. It does this by joining the relevant tables through their respective keys.

Question: what the abbreviation US stand for
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
The abbreviation "US" typically stands for "United States." In the context of a database schema that includes information related to aviation, travel, or geographic locations, "US" would likely refer to the country of the United States. If you have a specific table or column in mind where this abbreviation appears, I can help you construct an SQL query or provide further clarification related to that context.

Question: which airline is US
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "US" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about airlines that are based in the US, you can use a SQL query that selects the airline information from the `AIRLINE` table. However, since the `AIRLINE` table does not explicitly provide a country indication, and assuming we have an additional table or context defining which airlines are considered US-based, this query would typically look like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE
WHERE AIRLINE_NAME IN (
    -- List of known US airlines can be added here
    'American Airlines',
    'Delta Air Lines',
    'Southwest Airlines',
    'United Airlines',
    'JetBlue Airways',
    'Alaska Airlines'
);
```

If the airline information is directly available in the `AIRLINE` table without needing to cross-reference with another data source and the country is defined there, you could query like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_CODE, AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE
WHERE COUNTRY_NAME = 'United States';
```

Please make sure to modify the WHERE clause according to the actual structure of your database if necessary, as it is highly dependent on how the data is organized.

SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "HP" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the airline details for the airline code "HP," you would use a SQL query that selects from the `AIRLINE` table. Here’s the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM AIRLINE
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'HP';
```

This query will return all columns from the `AIRLINE` table for the airline that has the code 'HP'. If you need specific details (like `AIRLINE_NAME`), you can modify the query accordingly:

```sql
SELECT AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'HP';
```
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT *
FROM AIRLINE
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'HP';

Question: CLEVELAND to MIAMI on wednesday arriving before 1600
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To query flights from Cleveland to Miami on a Wednesday, arriving before 4:00 PM, you would need to join the relevant tables and filter the results based on the specified conditions. The assumption here is that "Cleveland" corresponds to an airport code, perhaps "CLE," and similarly "Miami" corresponds to "MIA." 

Here’s an SQL query that would accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday'
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Cleveland')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Miami')
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '16:00:00'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', d.DAYS_CODE, '%');
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting flight numbers, the airline code, departure time, and arrival time.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get names of the departure and arrival airports.
- We join the `DAYS` table to filter flights scheduled for Wednesday.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the flights to those departing from Cleveland and arriving in Miami. 
- It also filters for those where the arrival time is before 4 PM.
- Note that we use the subquery to obtain the corresponding `CITY_CODE` for Cleveland and Miami.

### Adjustments:
Make sure to adjust airport codes and city names in the subqueries according to your actual database data if they differ from your examples. Also, ensure the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is of the correct data type and format in the database (the above assumes it's a `TIME` format).

Question: list airports in LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list airports in Los Angeles from the provided database schema, you would typically query the `AIRPORT` table using the appropriate `CITY` code for Los Angeles. Assuming that you might have a CITY code for Los Angeles in the `CITY` table, the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE, A.AIRPORT_NAME, A.AIRPORT_LOCATION, A.STATE_CODE, A.COUNTRY_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT A
JOIN CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

If the `CITY_CODE` is known and you just need to list all airports directly in Los Angeles, you can skip the join and just query the `AIRPORT` table directly if you have the relevant information. Here is an alternative query if you have a specific `CITY_CODE` for Los Angeles:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION, STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT 
WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

Make sure to adjust the `WHERE` clause based on how city data is actually represented in your database (either through a city code or an airport location).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE, A.AIRPORT_NAME, A.AIRPORT_LOCATION, A.STATE_CODE, A.COUNTRY_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT A
JOIN CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';

Question: list airports in LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports in Los Angeles, you will need to write an SQL query that selects from the `AIRPORT` table where the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` (or possibly the `CITY_CODE` if there's an additional reference to cities) corresponds to Los Angeles. 

Assuming that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` field refers to the city where the airport is located, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

If there is a specific `CITY` table that contains more detailed information about city names, and you want to ensure accuracy, you can first find the `CITY_CODE` for Los Angeles and then join it with the `AIRPORT` table. The query can be structured like this:

```sql
SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE, A.AIRPORT_NAME, A.AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM AIRPORT A
JOIN CITY C ON A.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

Make sure to adjust the `CITY_CODE` references based on your actual schema's relationships.

Question: list airports in LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all airports in Los Angeles, you would typically need to search for city entries related to Los Angeles and then find the corresponding airports. Assuming the city code for Los Angeles can be found in the `CITY` table, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT A.AIRPORT_CODE, A.AIRPORT_NAME, A.AIRPORT_LOCATION, A.STATE_CODE, A.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT A
JOIN CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

If Los Angeles is represented in the `CITY` table by a specific city code, you may also need to ensure that `AIRPORT` has the corresponding entries. If Los Angeles has multiple airports, this will return a list of all associated airports.

In case you need a more specific condition based on the actual structure of these tables or if there are specific constraints, you can modify the query accordingly.

Question: list the airports in LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports in Los Angeles, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that "Los Angeles" is part of the `CITY` table, and we will join the `CITY` table with the `AIRPORT` table by using the `CITY_CODE` and `STATE_CODE`:

```sql
SELECT a.AIRPORT_CODE, a.AIRPORT_NAME, a.AIRPORT_LOCATION, a.STATE_CODE, a.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT a
JOIN CITY c ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

However, if the city names and codes are stored differently or if additional criteria are used, adjustments to the above query may be necessary depending on the actual data structure. If the airport's relation to the city is defined through another table (like `AIRPORT_SERVICE` or similar), you'd need to modify the query accordingly to accommodate those relationships. 

Assuming `CITY_CODE` is used to relate to airports through services, the query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT a.AIRPORT_CODE, a.AIRPORT_NAME, a.AIRPORT_LOCATION, a.STATE_CODE, a.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT a
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE as ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = as.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY c ON as.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

Make sure to assess your schema details to choose the correct logic for joining tables.

Question: tell me all the airports near WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find all the airports near Westchester County, you should first identify the `CITY_CODE` associated with Westchester County and then find all airports in the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table that are linked to that `CITY_CODE`.

Here’s a SQL query that could help you achieve that:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRPORT_CODE, a.AIRPORT_NAME, a.AIRPORT_LOCATION, a.STATE_CODE, a.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT a
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE as ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = as.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY c ON as.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE c.STATE_CODE = 'NY' AND c.COUNTRY_NAME = 'USA';
```

In this query:

- We're selecting distinct airport information from the `AIRPORT` table.
- We join `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to get the association between cities and airports.
- We also join the `CITY` table to filter the data for cities in Westchester County, typically in New York (NY). Make sure to replace any specific city criteria for Westchester County if needed.
- You may need to adjust the `WHERE` clause to more specifically find only airports serving Westchester County based on the city or specific conditions. 

Note: Depending on the structure of your data, you might need to adjust the query, especially how to identify airports specific to Westchester County.

Question: tell me all the airports in the NEW YORK area
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all airports in the New York area, you would typically need to filter the records from the `AIRPORT` table using the `STATE_CODE` associated with New York, which is generally "NY". Here's the SQL query to do that:

```sql
SELECT 
    AIRPORT_CODE, 
    AIRPORT_NAME, 
    AIRPORT_LOCATION 
FROM 
    AIRPORT 
WHERE 
    STATE_CODE = 'NY';
```

This query will return the airport code, name, and location of all airports located in New York. If you need to refine your search to specific cities within the New York area, you might need to join the `CITY` table as well. Here’s an example of that:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE, 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME, 
    A.AIRPORT_LOCATION 
FROM 
    AIRPORT A
JOIN 
    CITY C ON A.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C.STATE_CODE = 'NY';
``` 

Ensure you adjust any joins according to your specific database relationships if necessary.

Question: i need to RENTAL CAR at TAMPA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "TAMPA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE = "RENTAL CAR" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve rental car information for Tampa from a database, you would typically need a table that stores rental car details, which doesn't explicitly appear in the schema you've provided. If we assume there exists a `RENTAL_CAR` table or similar, the SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM RENTAL_CAR
WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Tampa');
```

This SQL query attempts to select all columns from a `RENTAL_CAR` table where the city code matches the code for Tampa.

If `RENTAL_CAR` is not part of the schema you provided, you would need to refer to the actual table structure or documentation that includes rental car services. If there is another related table, please provide its schema, and I can help you formulate a more accurate query.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT *
FROM RENTAL_CAR
WHERE CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Tampa');

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights that leave on Sunday from Montreal, Quebec, to San Diego, California, we will write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables, particularly focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `CITY`, and `DAYS` tables to filter by the specific cities and day of the week. 

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    a.AIRLINE_NAME 
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE_FLIGHT ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = c_from.CITY_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY c_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = c_to.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY'
WHERE 
    c_from.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL' 
    AND c_from.STATE_CODE = 'QUEBEC' 
    AND c_to.CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO' 
    AND c_to.STATE_CODE = 'CALIFORNIA'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', d.DAYS_CODE, '%');
```

### Notes:
1. This query assumes that the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field in the `FLIGHT` table uses a code that can be matched with the `DAYS` table to determine if a flight operates on a specific day (Sunday, in this case).
2. The actual columns and relationships might vary based on your specific implementation, so ensure that the field names like `FLIGHT_DAYS`, `FARE_FLIGHT`, etc. are correctly matched according to your schema definition.
3. Ensure your database has the relevant data for the cities and codes which have been used in the WHERE clause, specifically around city names and their state codes. 

Adjust the query accordingly if naming conventions or actual database structures vary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the flights from Phoenix, Arizona to St. Paul, Minnesota on a Tuesday, we will need to perform the following steps:

1. Find the airport codes for Phoenix, Arizona and St. Paul, Minnesota.
2. Determine the flight IDs that travel from Phoenix to St. Paul.
3. Filter those flights based on the day of the week being Tuesday.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, F.AIRLINE_CODE, F.DEPARTURE_TIME, F.ARRIVAL_TIME, F.STOPS
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AS1.AIRPORT_CODE
                                    FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS1
                                    JOIN CITY AS_C1 ON AS1.CITY_CODE = AS_C1.CITY_CODE
                                    WHERE AS_C1.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX' AND AS_C1.STATE_CODE = 'AZ')
JOIN CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AS2.AIRPORT_CODE
                                    FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS2
                                    JOIN CITY AS_C2 ON AS2.CITY_CODE = AS_C2.CITY_CODE
                                    WHERE AS_C2.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PAUL' AND AS_C2.STATE_CODE = 'MN')
JOIN FLIGHT_DAYS FD ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = FD.DAYS_CODE
WHERE FD.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Flight Details**: The query seeks to retrieve the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and number of stops.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` to filter out the desired origins and destinations.
   - The `CITY` table is used to get the airport codes based on city names (Phoenix, St. Paul) and their corresponding state codes (`AZ` for Arizona and `MN` for Minnesota).
   - `FLIGHT_DAYS` table is joined to ensure the flights are only those that operate on Tuesdays.
3. **Filtering by City and Day**: The query filters flights that depart from Phoenix and arrive in St. Paul specifically on Tuesdays.

Ensure that the appropriate indexes exist in the database to optimize the performance of these joins, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

Question: what does fare code F mean
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "F" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the meaning of fare code "F," you would typically query the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table, as it might contain descriptions associated with codes used throughout your database schema.

Here's a SQL query you could use to find the description for fare code "F":

```sql
SELECT DESCRIPTION
FROM CODE_DESCRIPTION
WHERE CODE = 'F';
```

If the `CODE_DESCRIPTION` table does not contain specific codes for fare types or if fare code "F" is documented in another way, you may need to look in the `FARE_BASIS` table, since it might also provide context or classification related to fare codes in the airline and travel industry.

For that, you could use a query like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FARE_BASIS
WHERE FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'F';
```

This will show you all details related to fare code "F," including its associated booking class or class type, and any conditions that apply.

Question: what does fare code H mean
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "H" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To understand what the fare code "H" means in your database schema, we'll need to check the related tables to get more information about this fare code. The key table in this context is likely the `FARE_BASIS` table, which links fare codes to their attributes.

Here's the SQL query that will retrieve the details for fare code "H":

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    BOOKING_CLASS,
    CLASS_TYPE,
    PREMIUM,
    ECONOMY,
    DISCOUNTED,
    NIGHT,
    SEASON,
    BASIS_DAYS
FROM 
    FARE_BASIS
WHERE 
    FARE_BASIS_CODE = 'H';
```

This query will provide you the information associated with fare code "H," including the booking class, class type, and any specific fare attributes such as whether it's a premium fare, economy fare, discounted, etc. Depending on how "H" is categorized, this will help you understand its specific implications regarding ticket pricing and conditions.

Question: what class is fare code Q
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS FROM CLASS_OF_SERVICE AS CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0 WHERE CLASS_OF_SERVICEalias0.BOOKING_CLASS = "Q" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine the class associated with the fare code `Q`, you would need to join the relevant tables that contain the fare information and the class of service information. In this case, you would use the `FARE` table (which contains the fare code) and the `FARE_BASIS` table (which links fare codes to booking classes).

Here is an SQL query that retrieves the class of service related to fare code `Q`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS, 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE.CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE ON FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS = CLASS_OF_SERVICE.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE 
    FARE_FARE_ID = 'Q';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting the `BOOKING_CLASS` and the associated `CLASS_DESCRIPTION` from `CLASS_OF_SERVICE`.
- The `FARE` table is joined with `FARE_BASIS` on the `FARE_BASIS_CODE`.
- Then we join `FARE_BASIS` to `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` on `BOOKING_CLASS`.
- Finally, we filter for the fare code `Q`.

Make sure to replace `FARE_FARE_ID` with the correct column identifier if it's named differently in your schema.

Question: list the airlines with flights to or from DENVER
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airlines with flights to or from Denver, you need to join the relevant tables to filter flights based on the departure and arrival airports that match Denver's airport code. Generally, Denver International Airport is commonly referenced with the airport code "DEN." 

Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_CODE, a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE a
JOIN FLIGHT f ON a.AIRLINE_CODE = f.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' OR f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects distinct airline codes and names from the `AIRLINE` table.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` from the `AIRLINE` table matches the `AIRLINE_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those flights that have either Denver as the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) or as the arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`). 

Make sure to adjust the airport code if necessary, depending on the actual way it's represented in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_CODE, a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE a
JOIN FLIGHT f ON a.AIRLINE_CODE = f.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN' OR f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN';

Question: how many NW flights leave ST. PAUL
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PAUL" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many Northwest (NW) flights leave St. Paul, you would need to identify the relevant airport codes that correspond to St. Paul, filter the flights by the airline code for Northwest, and count the results. 

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NW_FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW' 
AND FROM_AIRPORT IN (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
    FROM AIRPORT 
    WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'St. Paul'
);
```

This query performs the following:
1. It counts the number of records in the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'NW' (Northwest Airlines).
2. It also checks if the flight's `FROM_AIRPORT` is one of the airports associated with St. Paul by looking up `AIRPORT_CODE` from the `AIRPORT` table where `AIRPORT_LOCATION` matches 'St. Paul'. 

Make sure to replace `'St. Paul'` with the exact naming used in your database if it differs. Also, confirm that 'NW' is the correct airline code for Northwest Airlines in your dataset.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NW_FLIGHT_COUNT
FROM FLIGHT

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the airfares for FIRST class round trips from Detroit to St. Petersburg, we need to join several tables based on flight and fare information while filtering for the specific route and class type. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FA.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE_FAIR FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Detroit' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'St. Petersburg' AND
    FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST' AND
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `FLIGHT_FARE` to associate flights with their fares.
- The `FARE` table provides the fare details.
- The `FARE_BASIS` table is used to filter for the specific booking class (FIRST class).
- The `AIRPORT` table is used to ensure we're filtering both the departure airport (Detroit) and arrival airport (St. Petersburg).
- The condition `FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'` ensures we retrieve only round-trip fares.
  
Make sure the airport names you are using ('Detroit' and 'St. Petersburg') are accurate; you should replace them with the exact airport names or codes if needed.

Question: list COACH round trip airfare from DETROIT to ST. PETERSBURG
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "COACH" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the coach round-trip airfare from Detroit to St. Petersburg, you'll need to join the relevant tables to get the necessary data. The relevant tables from the schema include `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and possibly `FLIGHT` or `FLIGHT_FARE` depending on your exact requirements.

Assuming that "coach" refers to the class of service defined in `FARE_BASIS`, we can filter & join the tables adequately.

Here is a SQL query that you could use to obtain the round-trip fare for coach class from Detroit to St. Petersburg:

```sql
SELECT 
    FARE.FARE_ID,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    FARE_AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_FROM ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_TO ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE AS FARE_AIRLINE ON FARE.FARE_AIRLINE = FARE_AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Detroit' 
    AND AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'St. Petersburg'
    AND FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS = 'C'  -- assuming 'C' denotes coach class
    AND FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- assuming 'Y' denotes required for round trip
```

**Note:**
1. Ensure that the `BOOKING_CLASS` for "COACH" is correctly represented in your `FARE_BASIS` table (it might not be 'C'). 
2. Replace 'Detroit' and 'St. Petersburg' with the exact airport codes or names as per your database standards, if necessary.
3. Depending on the structure and relationships in your database, the table names and columns referenced may require adjustment.

Question: show me the cost of a FIRST class ticket from DETROIT to LAS VEGAS and back
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FARE_BASIS AS FARE_BASISalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DETROIT" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LAS VEGAS" AND FARE_BASISalias0.CLASS_TYPE = "FIRST" AND FAREalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASISalias0.FARE_BASIS_CODE AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL ;
Raw LLM Response:
To obtain the cost of a FIRST class ticket from Detroit to Las Vegas and back, you'll need to perform a query that joins relevant tables in the database schema, specifically focusing on the `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. You will also filter for the specific origin and destination airports, class type, and possibly airline details.

Assuming the airport codes for Detroit and Las Vegas are known (commonly DTW for Detroit and LAS for Las Vegas), the following SQL query could be used to find the costs:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DTW'
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAS'
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F'  -- Assuming 'F' is the code for FIRST class
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON f.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LAS'
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'DTW'
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F';  -- Assuming 'F' is the code for FIRST class
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - `FARE`: Contains fare information including costs.
   - `FARE_BASIS`: Contains details on the fare basis, including the booking class.

2. **Join**: 
   - The query joins `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables on `FARE_BASIS_CODE`.

3. **Filters**:
   - Filters for flights from Detroit (DTW) to Las Vegas (LAS) and back.
   - Filters the booking class to "FIRST" class, which is often designated by 'F'.

4. **Union**: 
   - Combines results from the forward and return flights.

5. **Results**: The query returns the `FARE_ID`, cost for a one-way trip, and round-trip costs.

Make sure to check the actual airport codes for Detroit and Las Vegas and adjust the booking class if it differs in your database.

Question: list all flights departing from SEATTLE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights departing from Seattle, you'll need to use the `FLIGHT` table to retrieve the relevant flight details, while also filtering the results based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` column. Additionally, you would need to ensure that Seattle's airport code is used in the query. Assuming the airport code for Seattle is "SEA" (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport), here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA';
```

This query selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table where the flight is departing from Seattle's airport code 'SEA'. If you want to include specific columns instead of all columns, you can modify the `SELECT` statement accordingly. 

Make sure to replace 'SEA' with the correct airport code if it differs in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares on flights from WASHINGTON to TORONTO on a Saturday, you need to join multiple tables in your database schema. The SQL query below assumes that the necessary airport codes for WASHINGTON and TORONTO and the appropriate relationships between the tables are established in your database.

Here is a possible SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'TORONTO'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We are selecting various flight details along with fare information.
2. **FROM Clause**: The main table from which we are querying is `FLIGHT`.
3. **JOINs**:
   - We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to link flights with their respective fares.
   - We join the `FARE` table to get details about the fares.
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get details on both the departure (from WASHINGTON) and arrival airports (to TORONTO).
   - We join the `DAYS` table to filter only flights available on Saturdays.
4. **WHERE Clause**: The conditions ensure that the departure airport is WASHINGTON, the arrival airport is TORONTO, and the flight is on a Saturday.

Make sure to adjust the conditions, especially those that filter by airport location, according to how your database schema stores this information (e.g., using airport codes instead).

Raw LLM Response:
To fetch the SATURDAY fares from WASHINGTON to BOSTON, you will need to join several tables in the database. You'll primarily be interested in the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `RESTRICTION`, and possibly the `AIRPORT` and `CITY` tables to get the correct airport codes for WASHINGTON and BOSTON.

Here’s how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    r.RESTRICTION_CODE
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fl ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON f.RESTRICTION_CODE = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BOSTON'
    AND r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a Saturday fare.
```

### Explanation:
- **Table Joins**: The query joins the `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `RESTRICTION` tables to gather necessary information related to fares, flight routes, and restrictions.
- **Conditions**: It filters for flights departing from WASHINGTON to BOSTON and ensures that the fare is applicable for a Saturday stay.
- **Selected Fields**: It retrieves the fare ID, one-way and round-trip costs, airport names, and restriction code.

Make sure to verify the actual `AIRPORT_LOCATION` and `SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED` column values/conditions according to your database schema specifications, as they might differ. Adjust the query accordingly based on the actual structure of your schema and requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve Saturday fares from Washington to Montreal, we need to join several tables. Based on your schema, we need to focus on the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `CITY`, and `RESTRICTION` tables to filter the results based on the origin and destination cities, and to ensure that the fares adhere to any specific Saturday travel restriction.

Here’s a sample SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST, 
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE, 
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE, 
    r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE fare
INNER JOIN 
    FLIGHT fare_flt ON fare.FARE_ID = fare_flt.FLIGHT_ID
INNER JOIN 
    CITY from_city ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = from_city.CITY_CODE
INNER JOIN 
    CITY to_city ON fare.TO_AIRPORT = to_city.CITY_CODE
INNER JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON fare.RESTRICTION_CODE = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    from_city.CITY_NAME = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL'
    AND r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = 'Y';  -- Assuming 'Y' stands for Yes
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Chooses the required columns, including flight number, airline, one-way and round trip costs, fare basis code, and the airline's information.
2. **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FARE` table which contains the pricing information.
3. **INNER JOIN** statements: 
   - Join the `FLIGHT` table to link fares to specific flights.
   - Join the `CITY` table twice: once for the departure city (Washington) and once for the destination city (Montreal).
   - Join the `RESTRICTION` table to access details regarding fare restrictions including whether a Saturday stay is required.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results to only include flights from Washington to Montreal, where a Saturday stay is required.

Make sure to adjust the `SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED` condition based on how the values are stored in your restriction table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the SATURDAY fares from Washington to Toronto, you'll need to join multiple tables to access all the necessary details related to fares, flights, and their restrictions. Here's an example SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID, 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN

WHERE 
    fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'WASHINGTON' 
    AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'TORONTO' 
    AND r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = 'YES';
```

### Explanation:
- The SQL query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` and `FARE` tables to get flight details between Washington and Toronto.
- It joins the `FARE` table with the `FLIGHT` table on the flight ID.
- It also joins the `RESTRICTION` table on the restriction code to filter the results to only those that require a Saturday stay.
- Replace 'WASHINGTON' and 'TORONTO' with the actual airport codes if they differ. The actual airport codes can be found in the `AIRPORT` table, if necessary.

Make sure to validate that the airport codes for Washington and Toronto are correctly mapped in the `FARE` table.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Saturday fare from Washington to Toronto, you would typically need to join several tables, including those that contain airport, fare, and restriction information. Assuming you have a direct fare between the two airports (from Washington to Toronto) and the necessary details are available in the appropriate tables, the SQL query could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON f.RESTRICTION_CODE = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'WASHINGTON'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'TORONTO'
    AND r.SATURDAY_STAY_REQUIRED = 'Y'; -- Assuming 'Y' indicates a requirement for Saturday stay
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: This selects the variables of interest, including round trip cost, one direction cost, fare basis code, and whether a Saturday stay is required.
2. **FROM Clause**: This indicates the main table (`FARE`) from which we're retrieving data.
3. **JOIN Clauses**: These are used to join the `FARE` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for Washington and once for Toronto) and the `RESTRICTION` table based on the fares' restriction code.
4. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results to ensure that we only get fares from Washington to Toronto and that the fare requires a Saturday stay. 

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` condition based on the actual values in your database, as they often include specific airport codes rather than city locations.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City on a Thursday, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the earliest flight (by `DEPARTURE_TIME`) from the `FLIGHT` table where the departure airport corresponds to Oakland and the arrival airport corresponds to Salt Lake City, filtering the results for flights on Thursdays:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
  AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
  AND d.DAY_NAME = 'THURSDAY'
ORDER BY f.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` twice: once for the departure airport (Oakland) and once for the arrival airport (Salt Lake City).
- It also joins with the `DAYS` table to filter flights that occur on Thursday.
- The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME` to get the first flight.
- The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the first result is returned. 

Make sure the names of the airports in the query match exactly with what is stored in the `AIRPORT` table, as they can vary based on your dataset.

Question: list the AS flights from BURBANK to anywhere
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights from BURBANK to anywhere, you can create a SQL query that retrieves the necessary flight details from the `FLIGHT` table. Given that you are interested in flights departing from BURBANK, you will specifically filter the results based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` column. 

Assuming that 'BURBANK' is the airport code for BURBANK, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'BURBANK';
```

If you want additional information from related tables (like airport details), you can use JOINs based on `FROM_AIRPORT` and any other relevant fields. For instance, if you want to include the airline details and airport names, you could write:

```sql
SELECT F.*, A.AIRLINE_NAME, AP.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BURBANK';
```

This query selects all flight details along with the airline name and airport name for the destination airport of flights departing from BURBANK. Make sure to replace 'BURBANK' with the actual airport code if it differs.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the AS (Alaska Airlines) flights from BURBANK, you will need to join relevant tables such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRLINE`. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.DUAL_CARRIER, 
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BURBANK' 
    AND F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```

In this query:
- We select flight details from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join it with the `AIRPORT` table to filter flights departing from BURBANK.
- We specify that we are interested in flights from Alaska Airlines by filtering on the `AIRLINE_CODE`. 

Make sure to adjust table and column names according to your actual database schema if there are any discrepancies.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights departing from BURBANK (airport code: BUR), you would typically need to join the `FLIGHT` and `AIRPORT` tables to get the relevant flight information. Here's an example SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT,

FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR';
```

In this query:
- We're selecting flight number, airline code, departure time, to airport, and the name of the airport from which the flight is departing.
- We're joining the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get flight details associated with the 'BUR' airport code.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight on American Airlines (AA) from Miami to Chicago that arrives around 5 PM, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,

    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MIAMI'
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'CHICAGO'
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '17:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects necessary flight details (like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, etc.).
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the name of the airline.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only flights operated by American Airlines (AA) from Miami to Chicago.
- It also restricts the results to flights that arrive between 5 PM and 5:59 PM. 

Make sure to adjust the airport codes (`FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`) as per your database's specific codes for Miami and Chicago, if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Miami to Chicago on American Airlines (AA) that arrive around 5 PM, you need to query the `FLIGHT` table for matching flights. You may also want to filter based on the `FLIGHT_STOP` table if you're considering only direct flights or have specific stopover requirements.

    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.ARRIVAL_TIME) = 17; -- 17 for 5 PM in 24-hour format
```

### Explanation:
- We select relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on:
  - The departure city being Miami.
  - The arrival city being Chicago.
  - The airline code being 'AA' for American Airlines.
  - The hour of the arrival time being set to 17 (which corresponds to 5 PM).

Note: This query assumes the `ARRIVAL_TIME` field is in a time format that allows extraction of the hour portion using `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ...)` which is typical in SQL databases.

Adjust the query as needed based on specific database syntax rules and any other requirements.

Question: show me the airports serviced by FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To extract the airports serviced by a specific airline with the code "FF," you will want to join relevant tables that connect airlines and their corresponding airports. Based on the provided schema, there are several key tables pertaining to airports and airlines: `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, and others.

Here is an appropriate SQL query to retrieve the airports serviced by the airline code "FF":

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRPORT_CODE, a.AIRPORT_NAME, a.AIRPORT_LOCATION, a.STATE_CODE, a.COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT a
JOIN FLIGHT f ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = f.FROM_AIRPORT OR a.AIRPORT_CODE = f.TO_AIRPORT
JOIN AIRLINE al ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = al.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE al.AIRLINE_CODE = 'FF';
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT DISTINCT**: This retrieves unique records to avoid duplicates in the results.
2. **FROM AIRPORT a**: We start with the `AIRPORT` table, aliased as `a`.
3. **JOIN FLIGHT f**: We join the `FLIGHT` table, aliased as `f`, using `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` columns to relate airports with flights.
4. **JOIN AIRLINE al**: We further join the `AIRLINE` table to filter results specifically for the airline code "FF".
5. **WHERE al.AIRLINE_CODE = 'FF'**: This clause filters the results to only include airports serviced by the airline with code "FF".

This query will give you the information about all airports serviced by flights operated by that particular airline.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on the 27th of December, you need to join multiple tables based on the relationships defined in your schema. Here's a SQL query that should get you the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(f.FARE_BASIS_CODE) AS Cheapest_Fare_Basis_Code,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS One_Way_Cost,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS Round_Trip_Cost
FROM 
    FLIGHT fl
JOIN 
    FARE f ON fl.FLIGHT_ID = f.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON fl.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON fl.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY dd ON dd.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 AND dd.DAY_NUMBER = 27 -- Assuming the YEAR is included in the FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Indianapolis' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando' AND 
    fl.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', dd.DAY_NAME, '%') -- Ensure that the flight is available on that day
GROUP BY 
    f.FARE_BASIS_CODE;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Join Tables:** The query joins the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, and `AIRPORT` tables to map flights from one airport to another and retrieve fare information.

2. **Filter by Airports:** The `WHERE` clause filters the records to ensure the flights are from Indianapolis to Orlando.

3. **Filter by Date:** The `JOIN` with the `DATE_DAY` table checks for flights available on December 27th.

4. **Minimize Fare:** We use the `MIN()` function to find the cheapest fare based on the cost attributes in the `FARE` table.

5. **Ensure Grouping:** The results are grouped by the fare basis code to provide a correct summary.

Make sure to replace `'Indianapolis'` and `'Orlando'` with the actual airport names if they differ from those in your `AIRPORT` table. This query assumes that the day of the week in `FLIGHT_DAYS` and the `DAY_NAME` from the `DATE_DAY` table can be matched accordingly. Adjust the filtering conditions based on actual data representation in your schema (for instance, you might need to handle varied formats for `FLIGHT_DAYS`).

Question: what is the seating capacity of an M80
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "M80" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the seating capacity of an M80 aircraft (which refers to the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series), you would query the `AIRCRAFT` table for the specific `AIRCRAFT_CODE` associated with the M80 and retrieve the `CAPACITY` field.

Here's the SQL query you would use:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY 
FROM AIRCRAFT 
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%M80%' OR AIRCRAFT_CODE = 'M80';
```

Make sure to replace `'M80'` with the actual `AIRCRAFT_CODE` if you know it, or adjust the condition in the `LIKE` clause to match the exact description if needed. If you have a specific `AIRCRAFT_CODE` for the M80, using that would make the query more efficient.

Question: what is the seating capacity of a 757
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the seating capacity of a Boeing 757 from the provided database schema, you would typically query the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION` contains "757".

Here’s an example SQL query that would provide the seating capacity of the Boeing 757:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY

Question: how many people will a 757 hold
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many people a Boeing 757 can hold, we need to query the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION` (or `AIRCRAFT_CODE` if you have that instead) corresponds to a 757. From the schema, the relevant field for passenger capacity is `CAPACITY`.

Here is an example SQL query that retrieves the seating capacity for a Boeing 757:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION = 'Boeing 757';
```

If the `AIRCRAFT_CODE` is used instead of the description and you know the specific code for the Boeing 757, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
WHERE AIRCRAFT_CODE = 'YOUR_B757_CODE';
```

Replace `'YOUR_B757_CODE'` with the actual code for the Boeing 757 if necessary. The `CAPACITY` field in the result will provide the number of passengers that the aircraft can hold.

WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION = 'Boeing 757';

Question: how many passengers can fly on a 757
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE = "757" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many passengers can fly on a Boeing 757, you would specifically look at the `AIRCRAFT` table to find the entry that corresponds to the Boeing 757 and then check the `CAPACITY` field for that aircraft.

Here’s an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT CAPACITY
FROM AIRCRAFT
WHERE AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%757%';
```

This query selects the `CAPACITY` from the `AIRCRAFT` table where the `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION` includes '757', which should cover any model of the 757 (like 757-200, 757-300, etc.). 

Make sure to adjust the `LIKE` clause if you have a specific naming convention in your dataset. If there are multiple entries for various types of Boeing 757, this query will return all corresponding capacities.

Raw LLM Response:
To query one-way flights from Milwaukee to Orlando after 18:00 on a Wednesday, you need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you'll need the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    ff.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'ORLANDO' AND 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00' AND
    f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%WED%'  -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS stores days in a specific format
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves relevant columns for flight details, including flight ID, number, departure and arrival times, and fare.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the primary table.
3. **JOIN Clauses**: Joins the `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to get the airport names and fare information.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to only include flights departing from 'MILWAUKEE' to 'ORLANDO', departing after 18:00 (6 PM), and on a Wednesday.
5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts results by departure time.

### Note:
- Make sure that the condition in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column is formatted correctly to match the actual values used in your database for days of the week.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for a one-way trip from Milwaukee to Orlando after 17:00 on a Wednesday, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that you have the necessary information about airports, flights, and schedules in your database.

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Orlando' AND 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00' AND 
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND 
    f.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming you want non-stop flights
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Columns**: The query selects the flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, the from/to airports, the number of stops, cost of the fare, and the airline offering that fare.
2. **Joins**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for Milwaukee and once for Orlando) to filter for flights originating from Milwaukee and arriving in Orlando.
   - The `FARE` table is joined to get pricing information for the selected flights.
   - The `DAYS` table is joined to filter flights that operate on Wednesday.
3. **WHERE Clause Conditions**:
   - It checks that the departure city is Milwaukee and the destination is Orlando.
   - It ensures the departure time is after 17:00.
   - It specifies to look for flights specifically on a Wednesday.
   - Optionally, I included a condition to check for non-stop flights (`STOPS = 0`), which you can modify as per your requirement.

### Note:
- Be sure that the field names like `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, and others match the exact names used in your database schema, and the time format in your database supports the conditions given.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Seattle to Chicago that have meals on a Saturday morning for the given database schema, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fd.MEAL_CODE,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE fd ON fs.MEAL_CODE = fd.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEATTLE' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'CHICAGO'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%CO%'
    AND fs.STOP_DAYS LIKE '%Saturday%'
    AND TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation of the Query
1. **Select Columns**: We are selecting flight details and meal descriptions.
2. **Join Tables**:
   - `FLIGHT f`: The main table containing flight information.
   - `FLIGHT_STOP fs`: Joining with `FLIGHT_STOP` to get meal information.
   - `FOOD_SERVICE fd`: Joining with `FOOD_SERVICE` to retrieve meal descriptions.
3. **Where Clause**:
   - Checking that the flight is from Seattle to Chicago.
   - Ensuring that the flight operates on Saturday by matching against the `FLIGHT_DAYS`.
   - Filtering for departure times indicating morning hours (between 6 AM and 12 PM).

### Note:
- Make sure to adapt the value in the conditions with the correct codes for SEATTLE and CHICAGO if they are not directly available as strings.
- Additionally, the specific representation of days (like 'CO' for Saturday) needs to be verified as per the data in the `FLIGHT_DAYS`.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Chicago to Seattle on Continental Airlines (CO) that have meal services early Saturday morning, you'll need to join several tables and apply the appropriate filters. Below is an SQL query that should meet your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE FS ON F.MEAL_CODE = FS.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON AP1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON AP2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' AND MONTH_NUMBER = your_desired_month AND DAY_NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND 6
WHERE 
    A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO'
    AND C1.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO'
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '12:00:00' -- Assuming early morning means from 5 AM to 12 PM
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Important Notes:
1. **Meal Code Filtering**: The query filters flights based on the meal code, but you might want to define criteria on what constitutes a meal available early morning (e.g., breakfast meals).
  
2. **Date Filtering**: You will need to define the specific month and adjust the `DAY_NUMBER` filter based on the date you are interested in (the current query uses a placeholder `your_desired_month`).

3. **Departure Time**: The time range for early Saturday morning is set from 5 AM to noon; you might want to adjust this depending on your definition of "early morning" or local time considerations. Depending on your time zone setting in your database, you may need to adjust for any potential GMT or local time offsets when specifying the departure time.

4. **Join Conditions**: The joins link the different tables to consolidate relevant information about the flights, airlines, and meals. Adjust the join clauses based on your actual schema if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Chicago to Seattle with meals that operate early Saturday morning, you would need to query the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `FOOD_SERVICE` tables. The SQL query will consider the arrival times on Saturday and filter for flights that include a meal. 

Here's an SQL query that can achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE M ON FS.MEAL_CODE = M.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO' AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'SEATTLE' AND 
    DAYNAME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 'Saturday' AND 
    (HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12)  -- Assuming early morning is before noon (12 PM)
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Table Joins**: The query joins the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `FOOD_SERVICE` tables to gather relevant information about flights, their departure and arrival locations, and meals offered.

2. **`WHERE` Clause**: 
   - Filters flights based on the departure city (Chicago) and arrival city (Seattle).
   - Checks that the departure day is Saturday.
   - Ensures the departure is in the early morning (defined here as before 12 PM).

3. **`ORDER BY`**: This will sort the results by the `DEPARTURE_TIME` for easier reading of early flights.

Be cautious with specifics like how "early morning" is defined, and adjust the `HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12` condition if needed. Also, ensure that the function names (e.g., `DAYNAME`, `HOUR`) align with your database system as SQL syntax can slightly vary between different databases.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Saturday morning flights operated by the airline with code 'CO' (Continental Airlines) that include meals, traveling from Chicago to Minneapolis, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the relevant tables include the necessary data for the condition specified.

Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fs.MEAL_CODE,
    food.MEAL_DESCRIPTION 
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE food ON f.MEAL_CODE = food.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY dd ON DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'
WHERE 
    a.AIRLINE_CODE = 'CO'
    AND from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Chicago'
    AND to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Minneapolis'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00' -- Saturday morning hours
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- This SQL query selects flights from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` matches 'CO'.
- It joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get fares for those flights and the `FARE` table to get additional fare details.
- It joins the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to get the meal descriptions, using `MEAL_CODE`.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures the flights are from Chicago to Minneapolis and are scheduled for Saturday mornings (between 6 AM and noon).
- The results are ordered by `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
  
Make sure to adjust any relevant column names, table names, or other specifics based on your actual database schema if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve Saturday morning flights from Chicago to St. Paul operated by Continental Airlines (CO) that have meals, you'll want to join various tables to access the necessary data on flights, airlines, meal services, and the respective cities. Here's how you could write the SQL query for this purpose:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE ON FLIGHT.MEAL_CODE = FOOD_SERVICE.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS TO_CITY ON TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYS.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO'
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PAUL'
    AND AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME = 'CONTINENTAL'
    AND DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY'
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59'
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables involved**:
   - `FLIGHT`: Contains information about flights.
   - `AIRLINE`: Filters for Continental Airlines.
   - `AIRPORT`: Retrieves the airport codes for both Chicago and St. Paul.
   - `FOOD_SERVICE`: Ensures that only flights with meals are selected.
   - `CITY`: Used to filter for the specific departure and arrival cities.
   - `DAYS`: Filters for flights on Saturday.

2. **WHERE clause**:
   - The city names for departure and arrival are checked.
   - Filters for the airline 'CONTINENTAL'.
   - Ensures the day is Saturday.
   - Selects flights departing in the morning (between 6 AM and 12 PM).

Make sure that all the table and column names accurately reflect your database schema, as case sensitivity and exact naming conventions can vary based on your specific SQL system. Adjust `'06:00:00'` and `'11:59:59'` according to the desired timeframe for "morning" flights if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Milwaukee to St. Louis that leaves Monday night, you will need to join several tables from the database schema you provided, mainly focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `DAYS` tables to filter the results accordingly. Here’s a SQL query that addresses the requirement:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    depart.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    arrive.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP AS fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS depart ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = depart.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS arrive ON f.TO_AIRPORT = arrive.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS from_city ON depart.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = from_city.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    CITY AS to_city ON arrive.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = to_city.CITY_CODE)
JOIN 
    DAYS AS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    from_city.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE'
    AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '18:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve from the joined tables, including flight details and airport names.
2. **JOIN Statements**: Connects relevant tables to associate flight details with departure and arrival airports and cities.
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
    - Filters to find flights departing from "MILWAUKEE" to "ST. LOUIS".
    - Ensures the flight departs on a "MONDAY".
    - Limits the departure time to flights leaving "Monday night" by enforcing a departure time of 6 PM or later.
4. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` for clarity.

Make sure to modify the structure according to your database's specific context or constraints. The `DEPARTURE_TIME` format may also need to be adjusted based on your SQL dialect (e.g., considering time zones or specific formats).

LOUIS" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To query for a flight leaving Tuesday night from St. Louis to Burbank, you'll need to join multiple tables in your database schema to gather all the relevant information about the flights. 

Assuming your airport codes for St. Louis and Burbank are known (e.g., STL for St. Louis Lambert International Airport and BUR for Bob Hope Airport in Burbank), here is a SQL query that would find flights from STL to BUR on a Tuesday night:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    D.DAY_NAME,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(D.DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ST. LOUIS' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'BURBANK' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday' AND
    HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 18;  -- Assuming "night" starts at 6 PM
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT`, which contains information about the flights. It joins with the `AIRPORT` table twice—once for the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and once for the arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`).

2. **JOIN Days Table**: The `DAYS` table is joined to ensure that the flights are only those that operate on Tuesday by checking `FLIGHT_DAYS`.

3. **WHERE Clause**: It filters results for:
   - Departure from St. Louis (replace `'ST. LOUIS'` with the appropriate condition based on how your `AIRPORT` table stores location data).
   - Arrival to Burbank (replace `'BURBANK'` likewise).
   - The day of the week is specified as Tuesday.
   - The departure time is checked to be at or after 6 PM, defining the "night" criteria.

4. **SELECT Statement**: The query selects relevant columns including airline details, flight numbers, timing, stops, airport names, and the day of the week.

Make sure to adjust column names or conditions based on your actual database schema specifics or if any codes need to be used instead of descriptive names.

To retrieve flights from Milwaukee to Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), you need to join several tables based on the schema you've provided, primarily the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially the `FLIGHT_FARE` tables if you want to include fare information. Here is a sample SQL query that retrieves relevant information about the flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Milwaukee' -- Replace with the actual name of the Milwaukee airport code
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DTW';
```

Please note:
1. Replace `'Milwaukee'` with the exact name of the Milwaukee airport. You'll need to check the `AIRPORT` table to find the correct airport code if needed. The airport for Milwaukee is typically Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport (MKE).
2. This query assumes you are looking for direct flights but doesn't exclude flights with connections, as `STOPS` field will represent the number of stops.
3. You can add additional `SELECT` fields if you require more information about each flight.

Question: show me a return flight from MIAMI to JFK please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "JFK" AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about a return flight from Miami (MIA) to JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), you would typically need to join several tables including the AIRLINE, AIRPORT, FLIGHT, and possibly FLIGHT_FARE to show flight details and pricing. Below is an example SQL query that demonstrates how to formulate this:

```sql
-- Fetching return flights from Miami (MIA) to JFK (New York)
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f1.AIRLINE_FLIGHT AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_AIRLINE,
    f2.AIRLINE_FLIGHT AS RETURN_FLIGHT_AIRLINE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f1.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE -- same airline for return
    AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE fare ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MIA'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'JFK';
```

### Explanation:

- **FLIGHT f1**: Represents the outbound flight from Miami to JFK.
- **FLIGHT f2**: Represents the return flight from JFK to Miami. This is joined based on the same airline code and matching airport codes.
- **AIRPORT a1 & a2**: To retrieve the airport names for more informative output.
- **FLIGHT_FARE fare**: To include any cost information associated with the flights.

Make sure to customize the query based on specific requirements such as selected dates or airlines and to include any additional details needed in your final output.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee on Wednesday operated by American Airlines (AA), you will need to join several tables based on the available schema. Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PHOENIX' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND 
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is the main source of flight data.
- `JOIN` is used to combine data from the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure and destination airports.
- The `DAYS` table is joined to filter for flights that operate on Wednesdays.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies:
  - The origin airport is Phoenix (assuming you have the correct airport name; alternatively, you could use `a1.AIRPORT_CODE` if you know the specific airport code).
  - The destination airport is Milwaukee (similarly, adjust to use the airport code if needed).
  - The flight is operated by American Airlines (AA).

Make sure to replace airport names with their corresponding airport codes if necessary, based on your database values.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information about Saturday flights on American Airlines (AA) from Milwaukee to Phoenix, we will need to join multiple tables based on your database schema. 

We will perform the following steps:
1. Filter flights based on the airline code "AA" and ensure the day is Saturday.
2. Get the appropriate details for flights from Milwaukee (MKE) to Phoenix (PHX), including departure and arrival times, and potentially the fares.
  
Here is an SQL query that can accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    FC.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    FC.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FC ON FF.FARE_ID = FC.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(D.DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MKE' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHX' 
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting data from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and `DAYS` tables.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline names.
- We also join the `FLIGHT` table with `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to retrieve fare information.
- We use the `DAYS` table to ensure that we are filtering for "Saturday" flights.
- The WHERE clause specifies:
  - The flight must be on American Airlines (AA).
  - The departure airport must be Milwaukee (MKE).
  - The arrival airport must be Phoenix (PHX).
  - The day of the week must be Saturday.
  
Make sure to update any specific identifiers (like airport codes) to fit your database correctly if they are different from what is assumed.

```

### Important Notes:
1. **Replace Placeholders**: You need to replace `{next_year}`, `{next_month}`, and `{next_saturday}` with actual values derived from date calculations based on the current date.
2. **Join Conditions**: We're joining relevant tables to ensure we're filtering based on the correct cities and airlines' codes.
3. **Flight Days**: We're checking if the flight operates on the specific Saturday by verifying the `FLIGHT_DAYS` attribute against the calculated day of the week.
4. **Flight Details**: The query returns various flight details like `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, etc., which you might need for booking.

### Execution:
You would execute this query against your flight database to retrieve the matching flight details for booking. After fetching the results, you can proceed to create a booking entry in the appropriate tables in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To find all the round-trip flights from Burbank (BUR) to Milwaukee (MKE), stopping in St. Louis (STL), you will need to join several tables to get the necessary information. Below is a possible SQL query that retrieves the desired data:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE,
    fs.MEAL_CODE,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BUR' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MKE'
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'STL'
    AND f.STOPS = 1
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:
- `FLIGHT` table (`f`): Contains the basic flight information.
- `FLIGHT_STOP` table (`fs`): Joins on `FLIGHT_ID` to access flight stops.
- `FARE` table: To get the costs associated with the flights.
- `WHERE` clause: Filters results to flights from BUR to MKE, with a stop in STL, where flights are round-trip.
- The query also specifies that we desire flights with a single stop (`STOPS = 1`) and that the round trip is required (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).

Make sure to adjust the column names and types in the result set according to your needs and ensure all joins accurately reflect your database schema relationships. Additionally, some of the fields might need modification based on specific use-case requirements or additional constraints.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest round trip fare from Indianapolis (IND) to Orlando (MCO) on December 25, you would generally follow these steps in your SQL query:

1. Identify the relevant airports for Indianapolis and Orlando.
2. Find flights from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 25.
3. Join with the fare information to get the round trip costs.
4. Filter for the cheapest fare.

Here's how the SQL query might look:

```sql
WITH DepartureFlights AS (
    SELECT 
        f.FLIGHT_ID,
        f.FROM_AIRPORT,
        f.TO_AIRPORT,
        f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        ff.FARE_ID,
        fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
    FROM 
        FLIGHT f
    JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
    JOIN FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
    WHERE 
        f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IND' 
        AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO'
        AND DATE_DAY.MONTH_NUMBER = 12 
        AND DATE_DAY.DAY_NUMBER = 25
),

ReturnFlights AS (
    SELECT 
        f.FLIGHT_ID,
        f.FROM_AIRPORT,
        f.TO_AIRPORT,
        f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        ff.FARE_ID
    FROM 
        FLIGHT f
    JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
    WHERE 
        f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' 
        AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'IND'
)

SELECT 
    MIN(DepartureFlights.ROUND_TRIP_COST) AS Cheapest_Round_Trip_Fare
FROM 
    DepartureFlights
JOIN 
    ReturnFlights ON DepartureFlights.FARE_ID = ReturnFlights.FARE_ID;
```

**Note:** The above query assumes the following:
- The specific date filter for December 25 is applied in the `WHERE` clause. If there are other date tables that manage the day of the month, you would need to adjust the SQL to join on those properly.
- The fare information might need to be joined on additional keys if the fares vary by return flights as well.

Make sure to verify the appropriate keys and column names you have in your schema for accurate retrieval.

### Explanation:

1. **Selecting Flights**: The query selects flights from Indianapolis to Orlando (f1) and from Orlando back to Indianapolis (f2).
   
2. **Joining Tables**: It performs joins between `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` to get relevant data.

3. **Filtering Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause filters the cities and ensures the departure is on December 27.

4. **Cost Ordering**: It orders the results by the round-trip cost in ascending order to find the cheapest fare.

5. **Return Date**: The query assumes a return flight could be picked 2 days after (on December 29) - you may want to adjust this based on actual travel preferences.

6. **Limit**: Finally, it uses `LIMIT 1` to return only the cheapest option.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace the specific dates and adjust the departure and return date logic as required for your application. 
- Ensure that the time format for `DEPARTURE_TIME` is appropriately matched with your database's format (e.g., if it's a datetime type). Adjust accordingly if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve First Class flights from New York to Miami that are round trip, you would typically perform a SQL query involving several of the tables in your database schema — mainly focusing on `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and possibly related tables for the airports and airline information.

Assuming that "NEW YORK" and "MIAMI" are the respective city names and that there are specific airport codes associated with these cities, let’s assume:

- The airport code for New York (e.g., JFK)
- The airport code for Miami (e.g., MIA)

Below is an example SQL query to select First Class round-trip flights from New York to Miami:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA'
    AND fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F'  -- Assuming 'F' is the code for First Class
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Notes:
- This query assumes that:
  - The Fare Basis for first class flights is denoted by 'F'. You may need to adjust this based on your `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` table if the representation is different.
  - The airport codes ('JFK' for New York and 'MIA' for Miami) may need to be replaced with the actual codes in your database.
- Make sure that the joins and conditions reflect the actual relationships and constraints of your database.
- Modify the SELECT statement as needed to include any additional information you require (e.g., more flight details, class descriptions, etc.).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve first-class flights from New York to Miami for a round trip, we would generally need to join several tables in the database schema provided. Below is an example SQL query that would accomplish this task. Please note that the exact names of the columns and tables used in the query should match those in your database management system.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    F.STOPS, 
    F.CONNECTIONS, 
    F.TIME_ELAPSED, 
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST,

    FARE_BASIS ON FARE.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FARE_BASIS.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'NEW_YORK' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIAMI'
    AND FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    AND FARE_BASIS.BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST'
```

### Explanation of the query:
1. **Selecting Fields**: We are retrieving various flight details such as flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, the airports, the number of stops, and the cost of the fare.
2. **Joining Tables**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to link the flight with its fare.
   - We then join the `FARE` table to get the fare details of the flight.
   - Finally, we join the `FARE_BASIS` table to filter for first-class bookings.
3. **Filtering**: 
   - We restrict results to flights departing from New York to Miami.
   - We require a round trip (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`).
   - We only select first-class flights (`BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST'`).

Make sure to replace 'NEW_YORK' and 'MIAMI' with the correct airport codes from your `AIRPORT` table if needed, and adjust column names as required based on your actual database schema.

Question: list the AS flights arriving in BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the AS (Alaska Airlines) flights arriving in BURBANK, we will need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly others for additional details if necessary. Here’s a SQL query that retrieves the relevant information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,

JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS' AND
    a.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK';
```

This SQL statement selects the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and airport details for flights from Alaska Airlines (AS) that are arriving at BURBANK (the airport). The join is done using the `TO_AIRPORT` field from the `FLIGHT` table and the `AIRPORT_CODE` from the `AIRPORT` table.

Question: list airports
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all airports from the given database schema, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM AIRPORT;
```

This SQL statement selects all columns from the `AIRPORT` table. If you want to retrieve specific columns, such as the airport code and airport name, you can modify the query like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME 
FROM AIRPORT;
```

This would provide a more concise output with only the relevant information about each airport.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on a Wednesday after 18:00, you will need to join several tables in your SQL query. Here's how you can structure your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    D.DAY_NAME,
    MONTH.MONTH_NAME,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS DEPARTURE_HOUR,
    EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) AS DEPARTURE_MINUTE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON DD.DAY_NAME = D.DAY_NAME AND DD.YEAR = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) 
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > (current_date + interval '18 hours')
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Fields**: The SELECT clause indicates the fields you want to retrieve, including flight number, departing and arriving airport names, departure and arrival times, and more.
  
2. **Joining Tables**: The query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport), the `DAYS` table to filter by Wednesday, and the `DATE_DAY` table to ensure the correct year for filtering.

3. **Where Clause**: The WHERE clause filters the results to only show flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee, specifically on Wednesdays, and departing after 18:00 on the current date.

4. **Ordering the Results**: The results are ordered by the departure time.

### Notes:
- You may need to replace `"current_date"` with the appropriate method of getting the current date depending on your database’s SQL dialect (like using `NOW()` or `GETDATE()`).
- The use of `EXTRACT()` may vary depending on the SQL database you are using (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server).
- Ensure that all the fields are correctly matched according to the schema and database you are using. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific setup and database dialect.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland (using the corresponding airport code) to Milwaukee after 5:00 PM on a Wednesday, you will need to join the relevant tables and filter based on the specified criteria. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this task.

First, you must know the airport codes for Cleveland and Milwaukee. For the sake of this example, let's assume:
- **Cleveland** airport code is `CLE`
- **Milwaukee** airport code is `MKE`

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    A.NOTE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP FROM_AIRPORT ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AP.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP TO_AIRPORT ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    AP_FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND AP_TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'MILWAUKEE'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%WED%';  -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS encodes days, and 'WED' represents Wednesday
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT**: This part specifies the columns you want to retrieve: flight ID, number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and airport information.
- **FROM FLIGHT F**: This indicates that the main table for your data retrieval is the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOIN**: You join the `AIRLINE` and `AIRPORT` tables to get details regarding the airline and airport codes. 
- **WHERE**: This section filters the results:
  - **AP_FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION** checks that the flight is departing from Cleveland.
  - **AP_TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION** checks that the flight is going to Milwaukee.
  - **F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00'** ensures that the flight departure is after 5:00 PM.
  - **F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%WED%'** checks that the flight is available on Wednesdays.

Make sure to adjust airport codes and any specific field names to match your actual database schema if needed.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesdays after 17:00, you would need to join several tables based on the relationships between flights, airports, and days of the week.

Here's the SQL query you can use based on the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' 
    AND TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) > '17:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. The query selects relevant fields from the `FLIGHT` table and related airport names from the `AIRPORT` table.
2. It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both the departure and arrival airports.
3. It also joins with the `DAYS` table to filter flights occurring on Wednesday.
4. The `WHERE` clause filters for departures from Cleveland to Milwaukee and ensures the departure time is after 17:00. 

**Note:** The exact city and airport codes (like CLEVELAND and MILWAUKEE) need to be valid as per your database's `CITY` or `AIRPORT` tables, as the provided schema does not have specific city or airport codes. Adjust the query accordingly if those codes are different in your actual database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights departing from Cleveland to Milwaukee on Wednesdays after 17:00, you will need to join several tables to access all the relevant information. The query will use the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and potentially the `DATE_DAY` table to filter based on the day and time. Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT, 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.STOPS, 
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 17
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including flight numbers, airline codes, airport names, departure and arrival times, stops, and elapsed time.
- **FROM**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOINs**: 
  - Join with `AIRPORT` to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
  - Join with `CITY` to ensure that we are retrieving flights related to the specified cities.
  - Join with `DAYS` to filter flights that depart specifically on Wednesdays.
- **WHERE**: 
  - Filters out flights that start from Cleveland and end in Milwaukee.
  - Ensures flights are only considered if they depart on Wednesday.
  - Uses `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM...)` to filter flights that depart after 17:00 (5 PM).
- **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by the departure time for easier readability.

Ensure you have the correct structure and populated data in your tables as described in the provided schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Salt Lake City to Phoenix departing on Wednesday after 17:00, you will need to join several tables in your SQL query to retrieve the necessary information regarding flights, airports, and the specific day of the week. 

Here's an example SQL query you could use:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_FROM ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_TO ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS CITY_FROM ON AIRPORT_FROM.CITY_CODE = CITY_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS CITY_TO ON AIRPORT_TO.CITY_CODE = CITY_TO.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    CITY_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
    AND CITY_TO.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX'
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00' -- Filter for departures after 17:00
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS IN (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday') -- Filter for Wednesday
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM** Clause:
   - We're selecting from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains flight schedule information.

2. **JOIN Statements**:
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to fetch the airport names for both the departure and destination airports.
   - We also join the `CITY` table to filter down the airports based on the city names.

3. **WHERE** Clause:
   - We filter for flights where the departure city is Salt Lake City and the arrival city is Phoenix.
   - We ensure the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is after 17:00.
   - We check the `FLIGHT_DAYS` against a subquery that retrieves the `DAYS_CODE` for Wednesday.

4. **ORDER BY Clause**:
   - Finally, we order the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` so that the earliest flights appear first.

Please adjust the table and column names as necessary to conform with the actual names in your database schema.

Question: i need a flight from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on wednesday departing after 1800
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City on a Wednesday that depart after 18:00, you'll need to join several tables based on the relevant fields. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'OAK'              -- Assuming OAK is the city code for Oakland
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = 'SLC'          -- Assuming SLC is the city code for Salt Lake City
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '18:00:00';
```

### Notes:
1. **City Codes**: Ensure you replace `'OAK'` and `'SLC'` with the appropriate city codes for Oakland and Salt Lake City if they are different in your database (you may join the `CITY` table to get the correct codes based on city names).
2. **Departure Time Format**: The query assumes that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored in `HH:MM:SS` format or a compatible time format. Adjust the comparison accordingly if the format is different.
3. **Day Codes**: The `FLIGHT_DAYS` field in the `FLIGHT` table should correspond to the `DAYS_CODE` in the `DAYS` table to filter the day correctly.
4. **Additional Information**: The SELECT clause can be modified to include additional fields as needed, such as airlines and other flight-related information.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from New York to Nashville that leave after 17:00 on Wednesday, you will need to identify the relevant airport codes for New York and Nashville, find the corresponding flights, and apply the necessary time and day filters.

Here’s how the SQL query might look, assuming "JFK" and "BNA" are the airport codes for New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and Nashville (Nashville International Airport), respectively. You may need to adjust these codes based on your database values. Additionally, we will also check the days of the week (Wednesdays).

Here’s the SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = 'JFK'  -- New York Airport code
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BNA'  -- Nashville Airport code
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%'  -- Assuming 'W' represents Wednesday in your database structure for days
ORDER BY
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the flight records.
- **JOIN**: The query joins the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT table to filter the flights based on the respective airport codes of New York and Nashville.
- **WHERE**: This clause includes conditions to filter flights leaving from JFK to BNA and ensures the departure time is after 17:00, as well as confirming that the flight operates on Wednesdays.
- **ORDER BY**: This clause sorts the result set by departure time.

Make sure to modify the airport codes and day representation based on the actual values present in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight and airline information for flights from Denver to Salt Lake City on a Monday departing after 17:00, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the relevant columns are correctly named and the relationships between the tables are appropriately established, based on the provided schema.

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT_ARRIVAL.TO_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT_ARRIVAL.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT.DUAL_CARRIER
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DENVER' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SALT LAKE CITY' 
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME > '17:00:00' 
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%M%' -- Ensure it includes Monday
```

Notes:
- Replace `'DENVER'` and `'SALT LAKE CITY'` with the actual airport codes for Denver and Salt Lake City if they are coded differently in your `AIRPORT` table.
- The condition `FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%M%'` assumes that `FLIGHT_DAYS` is a string that contains a representation of days, where 'M' stands for Monday.
- You may need to format the `DEPARTURE_TIME` based on how the time is stored (e.g., a timestamp or string). If it's a string, ensure the format matches what is stored in your database.
- Ensure that all flight times are in the same time zone or handle the conversion if they are not.

Question: list all flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights arriving in Denver (assuming that 'DENVER' refers to the city’s airport code) between the years 2000 and 2100, you will need to join the relevant tables in the database schema. Here, you will primarily need to use the `FLIGHT` and potentially the `AIRPORT` tables to filter for flights that arrive at Denver's airport.

Assuming the airport code for Denver is `DEN`, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DENVER%' AND 
    YEAR(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100;
```

In this query:

- We select flight details from the `FLIGHT` table, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the airport codes for the origin and destination.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table to filter for flights that specifically arrive at Denver.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that the airport name includes 'DENVER' and that the year of the arrival time is between 2000 and 2100.

Note that you might need to adjust the logic for getting the year based on the database system you're using (e.g., using `DATEPART` in SQL Server or `EXTRACT` in PostgreSQL). Additionally, you should replace `A.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%DENVER%'` with the correct condition if you have the exact airport code for Denver (e.g., `A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN'`).

Question: list all flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights arriving in Denver between the years 2000 and 2100, you would need to join several tables together in your SQL query, specifically focusing on the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables. The `FLIGHT_STOP` table contains the arrival information needed to filter for flights arriving in Denver, while the `FLIGHT` table contains flight identifiers and other flight details.

Here’s an example SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT_STOP.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ARRIVAL_AT_DENVER
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_STOP.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    FLIGHT_STOP.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
    AND YEAR(FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: We select various columns from the `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables for display.
- **JOIN**: We perform an inner join between `FLIGHT` and `FLIGHT_STOP` using the `FLIGHT_ID` column to combine flight details with stop information.
- **WHERE Clause**: We filter for stops at the Denver airport (assuming the `STOP_AIRPORT` for Denver is represented as 'DEN') and restrict the arrival time to between the years 2000 and 2100.
- **ORDER BY**: To make it easier to read, results are ordered by `ARRIVAL_TIME`.

Make sure to customize the `STOP_AIRPORT` if the code for Denver is different in your dataset. Also, note that functions such as `YEAR()` will depend on the SQL dialect you are using; for example, in certain SQL flavors, you might need to use different date functions.

Question: list all flights on all types of aircraft arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of all flights arriving in Denver (assuming the airport code for Denver is "DEN") between the years 2000 and 2100, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRCRAFT` table and filter for the specific arrival airport and time range.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRCRAFT_CODE,
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    A.MANUFACTURER,
    A.BASIC_TYPE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT A ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'DEN' AND
    YEAR(F.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant flight fields including `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, airline details, departure and arrival times, and aircraft details.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table (denoted by `F`) with the `AIRCRAFT` table (denoted by `A`) based on the `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters flights that arrive at the specified airport (DEN) and ensures that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is within the years 2000 to 2100. Note that it is important to ensure that `ARRIVAL_TIME` is in a date format that allows for the `YEAR()` function to be applied. 

Make sure to adjust the airport code in the filter if it is different from 'DEN' based on your actual data.

To find all the flights from Cincinnati to any airport in the New York area that arrive next Saturday before 18:00, you'll need to join several tables based on the provided schema. The steps would include selecting flights based on departure city, arrival city, and the specified time criteria.

Here’s the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,

WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (
        SELECT AIRPORT_CODE 
        FROM AIRPORT 
        WHERE CITY_CODE = (
            SELECT CITY_CODE 
            FROM CITY 
            WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI'
        )
    )
AND 
    C.CITY_NAME IN ('NEW YORK', 'JERSEY CITY', 'NEWARK', 'BUFFALO', 'ROCHESTER') -- Add other relevant New York area cities if necessary
AND 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00'
AND

AND 
    DATE_DAY.YEAR = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL (7 - DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE)) DAY)
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We use the `FLIGHT` table `F` to retrieve flight details.
2. **JOIN Clause**: We join the `AIRPORT` table `A` to get the airport details of the destination (`TO_AIRPORT`), and subsequently, we join the `CITY` table `C` to filter for cities in the New York area.
3. **Subqueries**: We retrieve the airport code for Cincinnati using a subquery.
4. **City Filter**: We filter for city names that are relevant to the New York area. Adjust the cities per your requirement.
5. **Time Filter**: We ensure that the arrival time is before 18:00.
6. **Day of the Week**: We select flights only scheduled for Saturday (assuming 'S' represents Saturday in the `FLIGHT_DAYS`).
7. **Year Calculation**: We ensure the flights are occurring next Saturday by calculating the date accordingly.

Make sure to adjust the cities according to your specific requirements and check that `FLIGHT_DAYS` is represented as assumed above. The above logic predicts flight schedules typical for such a query.

Question: list distance from airports to downtown in NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.MILES_DISTANT FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the distances from airports to downtown in New York, you'll want to query the `AIRPORT` table for airports located in New York and the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table for the distances to downtown. Assuming downtown New York is represented by a specific city code in your `CITY` table, you would join the relevant tables. 

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this, assuming "NYC" is the `CITY_CODE` for downtown New York:

```sql
SELECT 
    a.AIRPORT_NAME,
    as.MILES_DISTANT AS DISTANCE_TO_DOWNTOWN
FROM 
    AIRPORT a
JOIN 
    AIRPORT_SERVICE as ON a.AIRPORT_CODE = as.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c ON as.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'New York' AND 
    c.STATE_CODE = (SELECT STATE_CODE FROM STATE WHERE STATE_NAME = 'New York');
```

In this query:
- We're selecting the airport names and their distances to downtown from the relevant tables.
- We're joining `AIRPORT`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` to relate the airport information with the downtown distances to ensure we're only getting airports located in New York.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for just the city of New York and its state. 

Make sure to adjust the `CITY_CODE` accordingly if the city code for New York downtown differs in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the Wednesday night flights from Oakland (OAK) to Salt Lake City (SLC), you will need to retrieve data from the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and possibly `DAYS` tables to filter for flights that operate on Wednesdays and depart at night. The definition of "night" can vary, but typically, flights that depart after 6 PM could be considered night flights. Here's an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.STOP_TIME,
    d.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK'
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY'
    AND CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) >= '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We are selecting from the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `f`).
2. **JOIN Clause**: Joining `FLIGHT_STOP` to get stop-related information and `DAYS` to filter by the day of the week.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filtering for flights that depart from Oakland (`OAK`) to Salt Lake City (`SLC`).
   - Filtering for Wednesday flights based on the day name.
   - Filtering for flights that depart at or after 6 PM (`18:00:00`).

This query will return a list of night flights leaving Oakland for Salt Lake City on Wednesdays, including the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, any stop airports, and the day name. Adjust the time criteria in the `WHERE` clause if your definition of "night" is different (e.g., after 8 PM or others).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Memphis to New York on a Monday night, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that the relevant airport codes for Memphis and New York are known (e.g., MEM for Memphis International Airport and JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport). You may need to adjust the airport codes based on your database:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY' AND
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '18:00:00' AND
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '24:00:00';  -- Assuming night flights are after 6 PM
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is aliased as `f`.
- Two `JOIN` clauses are used to link the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to ensure you are getting the correct flights that depart from Memphis and arrive in New York.
- The `JOIN` with the `DAYS` table ensures that only flights on Mondays are selected.
- The `WHERE` clause filters:
  - For flights departing from Memphis and going to New York.
  - For flights that depart at night based on your definition of night (in this case, after 6 PM and before midnight).

Please make sure to replace `'MEMPHIS'` and `'NEW YORK'` with the appropriate airport names based on your actual database entries if they differ. You may also want to adapt the time conditions if your definition of "night" differs.

To retrieve first-class flights from Indianapolis to Memphis, leaving before 10:00 AM, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. The associated tables will include `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `CLASS_OF_SERVICE` to filter the flights appropriately.

Here's how you could write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT, 
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C_TO.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FARE_ID 
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE 
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS'
    AND C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'
    AND FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'FIRST'
    AND FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST IS NOT NULL; -- Make sure there's a cost
```

### Explanation:
- The query starts by selecting relevant columns such as flight ID, number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and fare costs.
- It joins `FLIGHT` with both `AIRPORT` tables to filter flights based on the departure (Indianapolis) and arrival (Memphis) locations.
- It further joins the `CITY` table to match the airports with the respective cities.
- The `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` tables are then joined to ensure we only retrieve flights that have first-class options.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures that we only consider flights departing from Indianapolis to Memphis and leaving before 10:00 AM. 
- Additionally, it filters for first-class bookings and ensures that there is a cost associated with the one-way flight.

Make sure to execute this query in an appropriate SQL environment that has access to your database. Adjust the column names if they differ in your actual schema.

Question: show me all round trip flights from NEW YORK to MIAMI nonstop
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , FARE AS FAREalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 , FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE ( ( CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all round trip nonstop flights from New York to Miami, you will need to join multiple tables in your database schema, particularly focusing on the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. Here's an SQL query that achieves that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS FlightNumber,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE AS AirlineCode,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DepartureTime,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ArrivalTime,
    f.STOPS AS Nonstop,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST AS OneWayCost,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST AS RoundTripCost
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' AND
    to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' AND
    f.STOPS = 0;  -- 0 signifies nonstop flights
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Columns**: The query selects important columns like flight number, airline code, departure and arrival time, whether the flight is nonstop, and the costs for one-way and round-trip fares.
2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `f`).
3. **JOINs**: 
   - It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice: one for the departure airport (New York) and one for the arrival airport (Miami).
   - It also joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to get the fare information.
4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters the departure airport to be New York (`from_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK'`).
   - Filters the arrival airport to be Miami (`to_airport.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI'`).
   - Ensures flights are nonstop (`f.STOPS = 0`).

You may need to adjust the airport names in the `WHERE` clause if the actual names do not match or if you have specific airport codes for New York and Miami.

Raw LLM Response:
To display all round-trip nonstop flights from Miami to New York, you would need to join several tables from your database schema. Below is an SQL query tailored to meet your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    fl1.STOPS AS DEPARTURE_STOPS,
    fl2.STOPS AS RETURN_STOPS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl1 ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl1.FLIGHT_ID AND fl1.LEG_NUMBER = 1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG fl2 ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fl2.FLIGHT_ID AND fl2.LEG_NUMBER = 2
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEW YORK' AND 
    fl1.STOPS = 0 AND 
    fl2.STOPS = 0 AND 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting columns**: This query selects relevant details like flight ID, flight number, departure/arrival times, airport names, the airline code, the number of stops, and fare information.

2. **Joining the tables**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` tables to get the airport names from their respective codes. The `FLIGHT_LEG` table is used to check stops for outbound and return legs. The `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables are included to fetch fare details.

3. **Filter conditions**:
   - Filters for Miami and New York airports.
   - Ensures that the flight is nonstop (`STOPS = 0`).
   - Checks if the fare indicates a round trip is required (`ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'`). 

Modify the airport names if they need to match the corresponding airport codes in your `AIRPORT` table. This query assumes the airport names for Miami and New York are 'MIAMI' and 'NEW YORK', respectively.

Question: get flight from TORONTO to SAN DIEGO stopping at DTW
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the details of flights from Toronto to San Diego with a stop in Detroit (DTW), you will need to utilize several tables from the schema you provided. Here, I will construct an SQL query to achieve that. The key tables we need to reference are `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `AIRPORT`, among potentially others for filtering out the airports.

Here’s an example SQL query that captures the necessary information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fs.STOP_AIRPORT AS STOP_AIRPORT,
    fs.ARRIVAL_TIME AS STOP_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.DEPARTURE_TIME AS STOP_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'TORONTO' 
    AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO'
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = 'DTW'
```

### Breakdown of the SQL Query:

1. **SELECT Clause**: This defines the columns we want to retrieve, including flight details, stop information, and departure/arrival times.

2. **FROM Clause**: We specify the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `f`) since it's the main table that contains flight information.

3. **JOIN Clause**:
    - The `FLIGHT_STOP` table (aliased as `fs`) is joined to get details about stops for each flight.
    - We also join the `AIRPORT` table twice (aliased as `a_from` and `a_to`) to get the airport names based on airport codes.

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
    - We filter the results to include only flights starting from Toronto and arriving in San Diego, and specifically those that have a stop at DTW (Detroit).

Please ensure that the airport names (‘TORONTO’, ‘SAN DIEGO’, and 'DTW') match the entries in your `AIRPORT` table, as they may need to be specified in a certain format such as Airport Codes (like YYZ for Toronto Pearson International Airport, SAN for San Diego International Airport, etc.). You might need to adjust the query accordingly.

Question: list all AS flights
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights that belong to "AS" airlines (Assuming "AS" is the airline code for Alaska Airlines or any airline with that code), you would typically query the `FLIGHT` table and filter results by the `AIRLINE_CODE` column. Here is the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```

This query selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table for flights where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is equal to 'AS'. If you would like to format the output or limit the columns returned, you could specify those columns instead of using `*`. For example:

```sql
SELECT FLIGHT_ID, AIRLINE_FLIGHT, DEPARTURE_TIME, ARRIVAL_TIME, FROM_AIRPORT, TO_AIRPORT
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';
```

This would return a more manageable set of information about the flights operated by the airline with the code 'AS'.

FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS';

SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID ) FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AS" AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine how many flights the airline "AS" (Alaska Airlines) has to Burbank, you would need to join the necessary tables to filter for the specific airline and destination airport. Assuming "BURBANK" is represented by its airport code in the AIRPORT table, here’s a SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS' AND TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK'
);
```

This query counts the total number of flights (`COUNT(*)`) from the `FLIGHT` table where the `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'AS' (representing Alaska Airlines) and the `TO_AIRPORT` matches the airport code for Burbank obtained from the `AIRPORT` table. Ensure that 'BURBANK' corresponds to the correct name or code in your database.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'AS' AND TO_AIRPORT = (
    SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT
    WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'BURBANK'
);

Question: show DL flights from JFK to MIAMI
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "JFK" AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MIAMI" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show Delta Airlines (DL) flights from JFK to Miami (MIA), you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves relevant flight information including flight number, departure time, arrival time, and connections for Delta flights from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Miami International Airport (MIA).

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    f.CONNECTIONS 
FROM 
    FLIGHT f 
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE 
WHERE 
    a.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
    AND f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA';
```

### Explanation:
- `SELECT`: Choose the columns you want to display: flight number, departure and arrival times, and connections.
- `FROM FLIGHT f`: Specify the `FLIGHT` table with an alias `f`.
- `JOIN AIRLINE a`: Join the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline information.
- `WHERE`: Filter for Delta Airlines (code 'DL') and specify the departure airport as JFK and the destination airport as MIA.

Make sure the airport codes 'JFK' and 'MIA' correspond to the respective entries in your `AIRPORT` table in your schema. Adjust the column names as necessary based on your actual database schema.

Question: what are the flights from LGA to SAN JOSE on UA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "UA" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to San Jose Airport (SJC) on United Airlines (UA), you can use the following SQL query. This query joins several relevant tables based on the relationships defined in your database schema to filter for flights meeting the specified criteria.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LGA' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'SJC' 
    AND F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'UA';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query

1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to retrieve:
   - `FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `AIRLINE_CODE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `ARRIVAL_TIME`, `STOPS`, and `TIME_ELAPSED` from the `FLIGHT` table.
   - The departure airport name from `A1` and the arrival airport name from `A2`.

2. **FROM Clause**: Starts with the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Joins `AIRPORT` table twice:
     - The first instance (A1) is for the origin airport (LGA).
     - The second instance (A2) is for the destination airport (SJC).

4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters results to include only those flights:
   - Departing from LGA
   - Arriving at SJC
   - Operated by United Airlines (`UA`).

Make sure to adjust the airport codes as necessary based on your actual schema (e.g., verifying that the airport code for San Jose is 'SJC' if you meant San Jose International Airport).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Milwaukee (MKE) to Phoenix (PHX) on Saturdays or Sundays operated by American Airlines (AA), we will need to join the relevant tables in your database schema including `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT_LEG`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, and `DAYS`. 

Here's an example SQL query that could be used to get this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_LEG FL ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FL.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP FS ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FS.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = FL.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    (F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MKE' AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'PHX') 
    AND A.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
    AND (D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' OR D.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday');
```

### Explanation:
- We joined the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to filter for American Airlines (`AA`).
- We joined `FLIGHT_LEG` and `FLIGHT_STOP` tables to access related details about the flight.
- The `DAYS` table is joined to check for Saturday or Sunday flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights specifically going from Milwaukee (MKE) to Phoenix (PHX) on the specified days with the required airline.

Make sure that your database contains the correct abbreviations for the airport codes and that the names in the `DAYS` table match the day names used. Adjust the query as necessary to fit your schema's data accurately.

Raw LLM Response:
To find an early flight from Milwaukee to Denver, you'll want to filter flights based on the departure airport located in Milwaukee and the destination airport in Denver. You'll typically need to join multiple tables to get the necessary information, such as flight times and relevant airport codes. Below is an SQL query that outlines how to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    L.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE L ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = L.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'Milwaukee%' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'Denver%' 
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME
LIMIT 1;  -- Get the earliest flight
```

### Explanation of the Query:

- We select relevant information from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRLINE` tables.
- The `JOIN` clauses link the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (`FROM_AIRPORT`) and once for the arrival airport (`TO_AIRPORT`).
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights that depart from an airport in Milwaukee and arrive at an airport in Denver. Adjust "Milwaukee%" and "Denver%" as needed to match your database's airport names.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by departure time in ascending order, ensuring that the earliest flight appears first.
- The `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the earliest flight is returned.

Make sure to replace the airport filtering conditions (`LIKE 'Milwaukee%'` and `LIKE 'Denver%'`) with the actual airport names or codes as necessary, depending on your database entries.

Question: please list afternoon flights between ST. PETERSBURG and CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. PETERSBURG" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of afternoon flights between St. Petersburg and Charlotte, assuming that the `FROM_AIRPORT` represents St. Petersburg and `TO_AIRPORT` represents Charlotte, you should refine the SQL query to select flights where the departure time falls within the afternoon hours (typically defined as between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM). Here's how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'ST. PETERSBURG')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE')
    AND TIME_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%H:%i') BETWEEN '12:00' AND '17:59';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query specifies which columns to retrieve from the `FLIGHT` table (e.g., flight ID, airline code, flight number, departure and arrival times, etc.).
2. **FROM Clause**: The `FLIGHT` table is referenced.
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - It filters for flights `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` based on St. Petersburg and Charlotte. The airport codes are selected using subqueries that get the appropriate airport code from the `AIRPORT` table.
   - The departure time of the flight is checked to be between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM using the `TIME_FORMAT` function to ensure we are working with the time in 'HH:mm' format.
   
Make sure the names of the airports match exactly as they appear in your database schema. Adjust any table or column names according to the actual database design if needed.

Question: list flights from CHICAGO to KANSAS CITY in the morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "KANSAS CITY" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Chicago to Kansas City in the morning, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table to find flights departing from the airport corresponding to Chicago (likely a code such as "ORD" for O'Hare or "MDW" for Midway) to the airport code for Kansas City (likely "MCI"). You will also need to filter the results based on the departure time to ensure those flights are in the morning.

Assuming the departure time is formatted in a way that allows you to easily check for morning hours (for example, if it's in a 24-hour format and you consider morning to be between 00:00 and 11:59), here is an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'KANSAS CITY')
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '00:00:00' AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We select relevant flight information such as flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, originating airport, and destination airport.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to ensure we fetch the correct airports based on the cities we are interested in (Chicago and Kansas City).
- We filter the flights by checking that the departure time falls within the morning range of 00:00 to 11:59. Adjust the time format as necessary depending on your database's configuration.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there are morning flights from Baltimore to Newark, you would query the `FLIGHT` table, joining with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport codes and using a time filter to find flights scheduled in the morning (let's assume morning is defined as flights departing between 5:00 AM and 11:59 AM). Here’s an example SQL query that can check for such flights:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEWARK'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '05:00:00'  -- Morning start time
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'; -- Before noon
```

Make sure to adjust the query based on the actual time format used in your database for `DEPARTURE_TIME`. This query checks for flights that depart from Baltimore to Newark during morning hours.

Question: show me the morning flights from MEMPHIS to NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "MEMPHIS" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To show the morning flights from Memphis to New York, we would first need to determine the airport codes for Memphis and New York. Assuming MEMPHIS refers to the Memphis International Airport (MEM) and NEW YORK refers to one of the major airports there, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia Airport (LGA).

After identifying the correct airport codes, you can craft the SQL query. Here's a basic example assuming MEM = 'MEM' and JFK = 'JFK'. The definition of "morning" typically refers to flights scheduled before noon (12:00 PM).

Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MEM' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'JFK' 
    AND CAST(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) < '12:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the relevant information from the FLIGHT table.
- We filter for flights departing from the Memphis airport (MEM) to the New York airport (JFK).
- We check that the departure time is before noon.

Make sure to adjust 'JFK' to the actual airport code for New York you are interested in, and similarly ensure the flight times are in the correct format if your database uses a different time representation.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Los Angeles to Charlotte that depart early in the morning, you'll first need to understand the relevant fields in your schema, particularly from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains key flight details like departure time and the involved airports.

Here's a SQL query that should give you the desired flights. For the sake of simplicity, let's define "early in the morning" as flights departing between 5:00 AM and 12:00 PM:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Los Angeles' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Charlotte' 
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We select flight information (including IDs, flight numbers, airline codes, departure and arrival times) and also the names of the departure and destination airports.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the airports based on their codes.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the records to only include flights from Los Angeles to Charlotte with departure times in the specified early morning range.

Make sure to adjust the flight times based on your database's time format if necessary.

Question: i would like a morning flight from CHARLOTTE to NEWARK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEWARK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a morning flight from Charlotte to Newark, we can query the `FLIGHT` table to check for flights that meet the criteria. We'll also need to join with the `AIRPORT` table to get the appropriate airport codes for both Charlotte (usually CLT) and Newark (usually EWR). Additionally, we can filter the flights by their departure time to restrict results to the morning hours.

Here's an SQL query that does this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE' AND 
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEWARK' AND
    CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
1. **Select Statement**: We're selecting relevant fields such as Flight ID, Airline code, Airline flight number, Departure and Arrival times, number of stops and connections, and the names of the from and to airports.
  
2. **Joins**: 
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of both the departure airport (Charlotte) and the arrival airport (Newark).

3. **Where Clause**: 
   - We filter to ensure we're only looking at flights departing from Charlotte to Newark and restrict the departure time to the morning hours (from 6 AM to 12 PM).

### Note:
Make sure to verify the actual airport names or codes in your `AIRPORT` table to ensure that "CHARLOTTE" and "NEWARK" match the expected code, as cities can have multiple airports.

Question: i'd like a morning flight from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To find a morning flight from Newark to Los Angeles, you would typically want to look for flights that have a departure time during the morning hours (let's say between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM). We can extract the relevant data from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and possibly `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. 

Here is an example SQL query that retrieves morning flights from Newark (`EWR`) to Los Angeles (`LAX`):

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR'  -- Newark Airport Code
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LAX'  -- Los Angeles Airport Code
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 6  -- Departure Time >= 6 AM
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12  -- Departure Time < 12 PM
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- `FLIGHT`: This table contains details of the flights.
- `AIRPORT`: This table is joined twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports using their airport codes.
- `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME)`: This function is used to retrieve the hour from the departure time to filter flights occurring in the morning.
- The conditions in the `WHERE` clause filter for flights from Newark to Los Angeles along with the specified departure time window. 

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_CODE` values (here 'EWR' and 'LAX') to the actual codes used in your database, if they are different.

Question: i'd like an evening flight from NEWARK to LOS ANGELES

Raw LLM Response:
To find an evening flight from Newark (likely represented by the airport code for Newark Liberty International Airport) to Los Angeles (likely represented by Los Angeles International Airport), you will need to write an SQL query that selects relevant details from the `FLIGHT` table. You will also need to join the `AIRPORT` table to filter flights based on the departure and arrival airports.

Assuming that the airport codes for Newark and Los Angeles are, respectively: `EWR` for Newark and `LAX` for Los Angeles, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Newark Liberty International Airport' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Los Angeles International Airport' AND
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '17:00:00';  -- Considering evening flights to be after 5 PM
```

### Explanation:
- The `SELECT` clause retrieves columns of interest, including flight IDs, flight numbers, departure/arrival times, and airport names.
- The `JOIN` operations connect the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to resolve the names of the departure and arrival airports.
- The `WHERE` clause filters to include only flights departing from Newark to Los Angeles and considers those that depart in the evening (after 5 PM in this example). Adjust the time logic to better suit your specific definition of evening if necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Denver to St. Louis on Tuesday morning, you would need to join several tables in order to get the relevant flight details based on the city codes for Denver and St. Louis, the days of the week, and the flight schedule.

Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this. This query assumes that you have the appropriate city codes for Denver and St. Louis. You will need to replace `'DEN'` and `'STL'` with the actual city codes used in your database.

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,

    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:
- **FROM**: Specifies the main table (FLIGHT) to query against.
- **JOIN**: Combines related information from the AIRPORT, CITY, and other related tables.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results to only include flights departing from Denver to St. Louis on Tuesday morning.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results based on the departure time.
  
Ensure to replace the placeholders with the actual codes for your database and validate the column names and logic as they might differ slightly based on your specific implementation and data.

LOUIS" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find available flights from St. Louis to Milwaukee on Wednesday afternoon, you will need to query the relevant tables to get the flights that match your criteria. 

Assuming you want to look for flights that have departure times in the afternoon (let's say between 12 PM and 6 PM), you would typically gather data from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables.

Here’s a sample SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE 
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%WED%'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18;
```

### Notes:
- The `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME)` function retrieves the hour component of the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
- The `LIKE '%WED%'` condition checks if Wednesday is a valid flight day.
- You might need to adjust the `DEPARTURE_TIME` condition based on how it's stored in your database (e.g., if it's stored as a string vs. a time type).
- Ensure that you handle the time zone of both airports if required, depending on how your data is set up.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Pittsburgh to Newark on Monday morning using the provided database schema, you will need to join several tables, including `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS`, among others. For "morning," let's assume you define morning as any time from 12:00 AM to 11:59 AM.

Here’s a sample SQL query that retrieves the necessary flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    RESTRICTION r ON ff.FARE_ID = r.RESTRICTION_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEWARK' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '00:00:00' AND '11:59:59';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns we want to return.
2. **FROM and JOIN**: Specifies the tables we are pulling data from and joining them on relevant keys (like airport codes and flight IDs).
3. **WHERE**: This filters the results:
   - Only flights from Pittsburgh to Newark.
   - Only on Mondays.
   - Departure times are between midnight and noon.

Make sure to adjust the names of `DAY_NAME`, `AIRPORT_NAME`, or other fields based on your actual data if they differ. Also, the `FLIGHT_DAYS` could be stored differently in your `FLIGHT` table, ensure that it corresponds correctly to the `DAYS` table that translates numbers or codes to day names.

Question: give me the flights from PITTSBURGH to LOS ANGELES thursday evening
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "PITTSBURGH" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Los Angeles (LAX) on Thursday evening, you'll want to access the relevant tables for flights and their details. We'll need to filter flights that leave from PIT, arrive in LAX, are scheduled for Thursday, and are categorized as "evening" flights.

The following SQL query demonstrates this. Note that we assume that "evening" flights start at 5 PM (17:00) and end close to midnight (23:59).

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'PIT' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAX'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%Thursday%'  -- Replace 'Thursday' with the appropriate code from DAYS table
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 17  -- Assuming evening starts from 5 PM
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) <= 23;  -- Assuming evening flights end by midnight
```

### Notes:
1. **Day of the Week Filtering**: The query assumes that `FLIGHT_DAYS` contains a string that indicates days when the flight operates (e.g., "MonTueThu"). If the day string is formatted differently, you may need to adjust the condition accordingly.
2. **Time Filtering**: The `HOUR()` function is used to extract the hour part from the `DEPARTURE_TIME`. Depending on the SQL dialect you are using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), you might need to adjust this, or you may need to convert departure time strings into time format for comparison.
3. **Self-Join**: The `JOIN` operation is used to connect the flights with the airlines to get the airline name.

If you need further customizations or clarifications, feel free to ask!

Question: give me the flights from PHOENIX to MILWAUKEE on wednesday evening

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee on Wednesday evening using the provided database schema, you can write an SQL query that joins the relevant tables to get the desired information. The query needs to filter based on the departure airport (Phoenix), arrival airport (Milwaukee), day of the week (Wednesday), and the departure time (evening, usually considered to be after 5 PM).

Here is a sample SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.DUAL_CARRIER,
    f.FLIGHT_DAYS,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%PHOENIX%' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%MILWAUKEE%' AND
    f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%' AND -- 'W' represents Wednesday, check if this matches your representation of days
    CAST(f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) >= '17:00:00'; -- Assuming evening starts at 5 PM
```

### Breakdown of the Query:

1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the details of the flights including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the primary source of data.

3. **JOINs**: Joins `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure airport (Phoenix) and arrival airport (Milwaukee).

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
    - Filters to only include flights from Phoenix to Milwaukee.
    - Filters for flights operated on Wednesday (assuming `f.FLIGHT_DAYS` includes a representation for Wednesday, often marked with 'W').
    - Filters for departure times that are in the evening (after 5 PM).

Ensure that the representation used for days and the time format aligns with how your database is structured. Adjust the query as needed based on the actual data and structure in your environment.

Question: give me a flight from CHARLOTTE to BALTIMORE on tuesday morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Charlotte to Baltimore on a Tuesday morning, you'll need to join multiple tables from the schema. Specifically, you'll be interested in the `FLIGHT` table along with the `AIRPORT` table to identify the relevant airports, and the `DAYS` table to filter for Tuesday.

Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE'
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Tuesday'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';  -- Adjust time range for morning flights
```

### Explanation:
- **FLIGHT F**: Selecting from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOINs**:
  - **AIRPORT A_FROM**: Joining to get the name of the departure airport (from Charlotte).
  - **AIRPORT A_TO**: Joining to get the name of the arrival airport (to Baltimore).
  - **DAYS D**: Joining to filter flights based on the day of the week.
- **WHERE clause**:
  - Filtering records for flights that depart from Charlotte to Baltimore on Tuesday.
  - Ensuring the departure time is in the morning (between 6 AM and 12 PM). Adjust the time range as needed for "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Tampa to Charlotte on a Sunday morning based on the provided database schema, you can use a query that joins the relevant tables while filtering by departure city, arrival city, and the specific day of the week. Below is an example SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    CITY city_from ON from_airport.AIRPORT_LOCATION = city_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY city_to ON to_airport.AIRPORT_LOCATION = city_to.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday'
WHERE 
    city_from.CITY_NAME = 'Tampa'
    AND city_to.CITY_NAME = 'Charlotte'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00' -- Adjusting for morning flights
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: We select columns of interest, including the flight number, airline name, departure and arrival times, the number of stops, and airfare costs.
2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT` aliased as `f`.
3. **JOIN Clauses**: We join other tables to get relevant information:
   - `AIRLINE` to get the airline name
   - `AIRPORT` twice to link from and to airports
   - `FARE` to include fare-related information
   - `CITY` to match the airport locations with the appropriate cities
   - `DAYS` to filter for Sunday
4. **WHERE Clause**: Filters the results by:
   - From city ('Tampa')
   - To city ('Charlotte')
   - Departure time is between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM to represent morning flights.
5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Results are ordered by departure time.

### Note:
- Replace the `FARE` join with the appropriate linking if it does not relate directly to `FLIGHT_ID` (adjust as per your actual schema).
- Ensure the times are appropriately formatted and consider the timezone offsets if necessary for the departure timing.
- You may need to adjust column and table names based on the specific implementation and any aliases used in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To construct an SQL query to find flights from Baltimore to Newark on Wednesday morning, you'll need to join multiple tables from your provided schema. The relevant tables include `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` for filtering by day, and you'll also need to consider specific conditions for the morning time. 

Assuming that "morning" refers to flights departing between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM, here’s how the SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Baltimore') AND
    A2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Newark') AND
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '06:00:00' AND  -- Morning start time
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';      -- Morning end time
```
### Explanation:
1. The `SELECT` clause lists the columns you want to retrieve, including flight details and airport names.
2. The `JOIN` statements combine the relevant tables. Three joins are included:
   - One to get the departure airport name (`FROM_AIRPORT`).
   - One to get the arrival airport name (`TO_AIRPORT`).
   - One to connect to the `DAYS` table to filter by the chosen day (Wednesday).
3. The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on:
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` as Baltimore and `TO_AIRPORT` as Newark using subqueries to derive `CITY_CODE` for each city.
   - The flight day as Wednesday based on the `DAYS` table.
   - The departure time to fall within the morning range.

Make sure to adjust column names or values as necessary to fit the design of your database and your specific requirements!

Raw LLM Response:
To extract information about flights from Miami (MIA) to Cleveland (CLE) on a Sunday afternoon, you'll need to join several tables based on your database schema. You'll need to filter by the departure airport, arrival airport, and day of the week, as well as the departure time to specify "afternoon" flights.

Here’s an example SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FLIGHT.TIME_ELAPSED,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT_2 ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT_2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE_FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN
    DAYS ON FIND_IN_SET(DAYS.DAYS_CODE, FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
JOIN
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MIA' AND 
    AIRPORT_2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'CLE' AND
    DAYS.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday' AND
    CAST(SUBSTRING(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 1, 2) AS UNSIGNED) >= 12 AND 
    CAST(SUBSTRING(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME, 1, 2) AS UNSIGNED) < 18
ORDER BY 
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **Join Tables**: The query joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT`, `FARE`, and `DAYS` tables to gather necessary details about flights and associated airports.
- **Filter Airports**: It filters flights departing from Miami (MIA) and arriving at Cleveland (CLE).
- **Day Filtering**: We check if the flight day is Sunday using the `DAYS` table.
- **Time Filtering**: The `DEPARTURE_TIME` must fall within the afternoon hours (from 12 PM to before 6 PM). The `SUBSTRING` function is used to extract the hour part of the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
- **Select Desired Columns**: Finally, the `SELECT` clause specifies the details you want to retrieve, such as flight numbers, departure/arrival times, and pricing info.

Adjust this query as necessary according to your database's specific SQL dialect and conventions.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for a route from New York to Las Vegas on Sunday afternoons, you would write an SQL query that joins relevant tables from the database schema provided. Assuming "New York" corresponds to an airport (in this case, you would know the airport code for John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and for Las Vegas, it's McCarran International Airport (LAS)), the following query would give you the desired results:

Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%'  -- Adjust to match specific NY airport code if necessary
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%Sunday%'  -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS contains day information
    AND TIME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '18:00:00';  -- Assuming afternoon is between 12 PM and 6 PM
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT**: This part retrieves the columns of interest such as flight number, departure time, arrival time, airport names, etc.

2. **FROM & JOIN**: 
    - The `FLIGHT` table (F) is joined with the `AIRPORT` table (A1 for departure airport and A2 for arrival airport) to get the names of the airports.
   
3. **WHERE**:
    - Filters for flights originating from New York (adjust the condition if needed by specifying the actual airport code).
    - Specify that flights need to land in Las Vegas.
    - Filter flights that operate on Sundays, based on the `FLIGHT_DAYS` which is assumed to hold day information.
    - Further restrict the results to flights departing in the afternoon, which is defined here as between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM.

Make sure to adjust airport codes and condition format based on your actual data for accurate results.

Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query that retrieves flight information from Memphis (MEM) to Las Vegas (LAS VEGAS) specifically for Sunday afternoon flights, you'll need to join several tables from the provided database schema. The results will include relevant flight details such as flight number, departure time, arrival time, airline, and any other details you wish to include.

Here is an example of a query that you might use:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    ac.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    f.CONNECTIONS
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT ac ON f.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ac.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MEM' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'LAS'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS IN (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Sunday')
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 12 AND 18  -- Afternoon flights (12:00 PM to 6:59 PM)
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: We are selecting various relevant columns from the flight data including flight ID, numbers, time, and details about the airline and aircraft.
  
- **FROM Clause and Joins**:
  - The main table is `FLIGHT (f)`, where you retrieve all necessary details for the flights.
  - Join with `AIRLINE (a)` to get the name of the airline associated with each flight.
  - Join with `AIRCRAFT (ac)` to include information about the aircraft type.
  
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Filter for flights that depart from MEM to LAS.
  - Filter for flights that operate on Sundays using a subquery to get the days code.
  - The departure time is restricted to the afternoon by extracting the hour from `DEPARTURE_TIME` and checking if it's between 12 (noon) and 18 (6 PM).

- **ORDER BY**: The results are sorted by `DEPARTURE_TIME` so that the earliest afternoon flights appear first.

Note: You might need to adjust the query based on the actual time format in your database; the use of `EXTRACT` assumes that `DEPARTURE_TIME` is of a time datatype. Adjustments may be necessary based on the SQL dialect you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).

Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from New York to Las Vegas on Sunday afternoons using the provided database schema, we would need to query a combination of the relevant tables, such as `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and `DATE_DAY` to filter the results based on the specific requirements. 

Assuming the flight departure time is considered in the afternoon as any time from 12:00 PM to 5:59 PM (i.e., 12:00 to 17:59), you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    c1.CITY_NAME AS FROM_CITY,
    c2.CITY_NAME AS TO_CITY
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = service1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = service2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM DATE_DAY dd 
        WHERE dd.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday'
          AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', dd.DAYS_CODE, '%')
    )
    AND TIME_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%H:%i') BETWEEN '12:00' AND '17:59';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` to get the airport names and with `CITY` to ensure we have the correct city names.
   
2. **City Filtering**: The query filters specifically for flights departing from 'NEW YORK' (source city) to 'LAS VEGAS' (destination city).

3. **Flight Days**: The query checks if the flight days include Sundays by verifying if the `FLIGHT_DAYS` contains the appropriate `DAYS_CODE` corresponding to Sunday.

4. **Time Filter**: The departure time is checked to ensure the flight departs between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM.

This query provides the relevant information about flights that match the specified criteria.

Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query for flights from Chicago to Seattle on a Saturday morning, you will typically need to join several tables to filter for the relevant details such as flights, departure times, and possibly flight fare information.

First, here’s a SQL query that focuses on retrieving flights from Chicago (from the `AIRPORT` table) to Seattle (to the `AIRPORT` table) on Saturdays. We will consider "morning" as being defined by a specific time range, for example, from 5 AM to 12 PM.

Here's how the SQL query might be structured:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    AIRPORT_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT

    AND DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'
    AND CAST(FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME AS TIME) BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns**: The query selects various columns from the `FLIGHT` and `AIRPORT` tables that provide relevant flight information.
2. **Joins**:
   - Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
   - Joins with `FLIGHT_FARE` to incorporate fare data, and `RESTRICTION` for any relevant restrictions on the flight.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights departing from Chicago and arriving in Seattle using subqueries to first identify the appropriate `CITY_CODE` from the `CITY` table.
   - Filters for flights that operate on Saturdays by checking the `DAY_NAME`.
   - Filters for departure times that fall within the defined morning time range (5 AM to 12 PM).

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `DAY_NAME` corresponds correctly to records you want. The `DAYS` table might be used for better filtering based on flight days.
- You may want to adjust the time range for different definitions of "morning."
- Make sure you have necessary indexes on the fields used in joins and filters to optimize query performance.
- Adapt the time handling as necessary, depending on the time zone if relevant to your use case.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Chicago to Las Vegas on a Saturday morning, you will first need to determine the specific flights that match the criteria based on the schema provided. This typically involves filtering for flights, ensuring you select flights departing on Saturday, and potentially filtering for morning departure times.

Here’s an SQL query that could be used to retrieve the desired flight information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    a.AIRLINE_CODE,
    d.DAY_NAME,
    m.MONTH_NAME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS 
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON c1.CITY_CODE = 'CHI' -- assuming CITY_CODE for Chicago is 'CHI'
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON c2.CITY_CODE = 'LAS' -- assuming CITY_CODE for Las Vegas is 'LAS'
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'Chicago' AND 
    c2.CITY_NAME = 'Las Vegas' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' AND
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 -- morning hours assumed to be between 6 AM and 11 AM
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Table Joins**: The query joins multiple tables (FLIGHT, AIRLINE, DAYS, and CITY) to gather all the relevant information concerning the flights.
2. **City Codes**: The query assumes you have the city codes for Chicago and Las Vegas, represented as 'CHI' and 'LAS', respectively.
3. **Filtering**:
   - It checks if the departure city is Chicago and the arrival city is Las Vegas.
   - It selects only flights that depart on Saturday.
   - It filters for departure times that fall within the morning period (assumed to be between 6 AM and 11 AM) using the hour extraction from the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.
4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by departure time for easier reading.

This is a basic query structure and can be modified based on your specific requirements or flight data details in your database schema. Make sure the actual city codes for Chicago and Las Vegas align with those in your database as they are assumed here.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles on a Thursday evening, you would typically want to gather relevant data from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and possibly `FLIGHT_STOP` tables. Here's an example SQL query that captures this requirement.

Assuming that:
- The `FROM_AIRPORT` code for Pittsburgh is available in the `AIRPORT` table (it is typically "PIT").
- The `TO_AIRPORT` code for Los Angeles is available in the `AIRPORT` table (it could be "LAX").

The query below retrieves flight details departing from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles on a Thursday evening (let's assume 'evening' is defined as between 17:00 (5 PM) and 23:59 (11:59 PM)):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    FL.FARE_ID,
    FF.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'PITTSBURGH'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LOS ANGELES'
    AND DAYOFWEEK(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 5  -- Thursday
    AND CONVERT(F.DEPARTURE_TIME, TIME) BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '23:59:59';
```

### Notes:
1. **DAYOFWEEK Function**: The function `DAYOFWEEK` is used here to get the corresponding day number for Thursday. Depending on the SQL dialect, you might need to adjust it (for example, in some SQL systems, the day number might start from 0 or 1).
2. **Time Conversion**: The `CONVERT` function is used to extract time from the departure timestamp. Replace it with the appropriate function for your SQL dialect if necessary (e.g., `CAST`, `TO_CHAR`, etc.).
3. The `FLIGHT` table contains flight information, `AIRPORT` table includes airport details, and `FLIGHT_FARE` table for fare-related information.
4. Ensure to adapt the column names based on the exact schema you have in your database (for example, if you are unsure about the airport codes or names).

Please adjust the query as necessary to match your environment and specific database standards.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights from Nashville to Memphis on Monday morning, you would need to join the relevant tables, particularly `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS`, to filter the results based on the departure and arrival airports as well as the day of the week and the time of day. 

Assuming that the morning is defined as flights departing before noon (12:00 PM), here is how you could write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    A1.CITY_CODE = 'NASHVILLE' AND
    A2.CITY_CODE = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    D.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00';
```

### Notes:
1. Ensure that the `CITY_CODE` for Nashville and Memphis in your dataset matches 'NASHVILLE' and 'MEMPHIS'.
2. You may also want to convert the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to the correct format based on how it is stored in the database, either as a string or a datetime datatype.
3. If the `DAYS_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table represents a specific code for the day, please ensure that it is correctly referenced (might require knowing the mapping of `DAYS_CODE` to actual days).

Make adjustments as necessary according to your exact database schema and data types.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights from NASHVILLE to MEMPHIS on Monday morning, you'll need to perform a SQL query that joins multiple tables based on the relationships defined in your database schema. Here’s an example SQL query that can fulfill your request:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE AND C1.CITY_NAME = 'NASHVILLE')
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS')
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'NASHVILLE' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' 
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Monday'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '06:00:00' -- Assuming 'morning' means from 6 AM
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '12:00:00'; -- End of morning before noon
```

### Explanation of the Query Components:
- **SELECT Statement**: This selects the relevant columns you want to display in the results, such as flight ID, flight number, airline, departure and arrival times, and the names of the airports.
- **JOINs**: Here, you join the `FLIGHT` table with `AIRPORT` to get the airport names, and use subqueries on `AIRPORT_SERVICE` to link the cities to their respective airports. 
- **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results to only include flights from NASHVILLE to MEMPHIS, flights operating on Monday, and those departing in the morning based on time criteria.

Make sure that the time format in your database matches the format used in the query for accurate results. Adjust the time range as needed depending on your definition of "morning."

Raw LLM Response:
To query a flight that leaves from Indianapolis to Toronto on a Thursday morning based on the provided database schema, you might need to join several tables to gather the necessary information. The relevant information likely resides in the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, `DAYS`, and possibly the `FLIGHT_STOP` or `FLIGHT_LEG` tables to consider any connecting flights.

Here’s an example SQL query that attempts to extract this information. It finds flights originating from Indianapolis (IND) to Toronto (YYZ) that depart on Thursday morning (assuming morning is defined as before noon, e.g., between 6 AM and 12 PM):

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    c1.CITY_NAME AS FROM_CITY,
    c2.CITY_NAME AS TO_CITY,
    a1.STATE_CODE AS FROM_STATE,
    a2.STATE_CODE AS TO_STATE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- This query retrieves the flight information including flight ID, number, departure and arrival times, and airport/city names.
- It joins the necessary tables:
  - `FLIGHT` for main flight details and times.
  - `AIRPORT` to map airport codes to names.
  - `CITY` to find matching city names for departure and arrival.
  - `DAYS` to filter for flights available on Thursdays.
- The `WHERE` clause specifies the origin city (INDIANAPOLIS), the destination city (TORONTO), restricts the flights to those departing on Thursday, and limits the departure time to the morning window (6 AM to 12 PM). 

Make sure to replace `IND` and `YYZ` with their respective airport codes if they differ in your database schema. Additionally, if there are specific time zone considerations, you may need to adjust the time filtering based on the time zones of the departure and arrival airports.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight information for flights from Toronto to Montreal on Friday mornings, you would typically need to join multiple tables to get relevant details, such as the flight numbers, departure times, airlines, etc. 

Assuming the cities are represented as 'TORONTO' and 'MONTREAL' in the CITY table and you also want to ensure that it's a Friday morning, we will need to filter based on that.

Here’s an SQL query that can achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    d.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS -- This assumes flight days are stored in a days code
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'TORONTO' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'MONTREAL'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Friday'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12 -- Assuming morning is before noon
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Notes:
1. **DEPARTURE_TIME**: This query assumes that `DEPARTURE_TIME` is in a format that allows extraction of hours (e.g., a `TIMESTAMP` type).
2. **CITY Relation**: It's assumed that the `CITY` table tells which city the airport is located in, and that `AIRPORT_LOCATION` refers to `CITY_CODE`.
3. **FLIGHT_DAYS**: This assumes `FLIGHT_DAYS` is encoded in a way that can be joined with the `DAYS` table to find the day names.
4. **Time Filtering**: Adjust the logic for determining "morning" as needed based on the data type of `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

Adjustments may be necessary based on your database's specific schema details or requirements.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a morning flight from Burbank (BUR) to Milwaukee (MKE) on the next Monday, you first need to determine the date for next Monday and then construct an SQL query that joins the necessary tables to filter for the flight details you want. 

Here's how you can write the SQL query assuming you've identified next Monday's date and have an appropriate method to fetch it from the `DATE_DAY` table or any other method you prefer:

```sql
-- Assume next Monday's date is known (e.g., 2023-10-30)
-- You may need to use a specific date or method to dynamically retrieve the next Monday's date

SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a1.CITY_CODE AS FROM_CITY,
    a2.CITY_CODE AS TO_CITY,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY dd ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = dd.DAY_NAME
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR'                    -- Burbank Airport
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'MKE'                 -- Milwaukee Airport
    AND dd.YEAR = YEAR(CURDATE())              -- Current Year
    AND dd.MONTH_NUMBER = MONTH(CURDATE())     -- Current Month
    AND dd.DAY_NAME = 'Monday'                  -- Next Monday
    AND TIME(HOUR(f.DEPARTURE_TIME)) BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'  -- Morning flights
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Relevant Information**: We select flight details along with the names of the airports.
2. **Joining Tables**: The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table to get the names of the departure and arrival airports. We also join with the `DATE_DAY` to filter by the day of the week.
3. **Filtering Conditions**:
   - We filter for flights departing from `BUR` and arriving at `MKE`.
   - We check for Monday flights.
   - We check if the departure time is in the morning (between 6 AM and 12 PM).
4. **Ordering Results**: The results are ordered by departure time for easier readability.

### Note:
- Ensure that the `DATE_DAY` table has the corresponding entries for flight days.
- You may need to adjust the calendar query logic to dynamically calculate next Monday's date programmatically. The SQL above assumes a direct date check or relevant way to reference it.

Question: and a flight from ST. LOUIS to BURBANK that leaves tuesday afternoon
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "ST. LOUIS" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from St. Louis to Burbank that departs on Tuesday afternoon, we need to construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables to filter based on the airports, days, and flight times. 

Assuming the airport codes for St. Louis and Burbank are "STL" and "BUR" respectively (these should be updated with actual codes if they are different), and that afternoon is generally defined as the time between 12:00 PM and 5:59 PM, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AC.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT AC ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = AC.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'STL' AND 
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'BUR' AND 
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%T%' AND  -- Assuming 'T' represents Tuesday
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:59:59';  -- Afternoon time range
```

### Explanation:

1. **Selecting Columns:** We are choosing relevant columns such as flight number, arrival time, departure time, airline name, aircraft description, number of stops, and time elapsed.

2. **Joining Tables:** 
   - `FLIGHT` is joined with `AIRLINE` to get the airline names.
   - `FLIGHT` is also joined with `AIRCRAFT` to get aircraft descriptions.

3. **Filtering Conditions:**
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` is filtered for St. Louis (`'STL'`).
   - The `TO_AIRPORT` is filtered for Burbank (`'BUR'`).
   - The `FLIGHT_DAYS` is filtered to include Tuesday. The `LIKE '%T%'` checks if the day code for Tuesday is present in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` string.
   - The `DEPARTURE_TIME` is filtered to be in the afternoon range from 12:00 PM to 5:59 PM.

Please ensure that the actual airport codes and definitions are used in your database where necessary. Adjust the query based on the actual `FLIGHT_DAYS` encoding and how times are stored in your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from San Diego to Phoenix on Monday morning, you'll need to join several tables, including the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DAYS` tables, among others. You'll specifically be looking for flights that depart from the San Diego airport and arrive at the Phoenix airport on a Monday morning.

Assuming you have the airport codes for San Diego (which is likely `SAN`) and Phoenix (likely `PHX`), here's an SQL query that can accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A_TO.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SAN' -- San Diego
    AND A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = 'PHX' -- Phoenix
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Monday'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12 -- morning flights (before noon)
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects relevant columns from the `FLIGHT` table and joins with the `AIRPORT` table to get airport names based on their codes.
- It also joins with the `DAYS` table to filter for only flights that operate on Monday.
- The `EXTRACT` function is used to select flights that depart in the morning (before noon).
- Adjust `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ...) < 12` if your definition of "morning" includes noon or a different time frame.
- The results are ordered by the departure time for better readability. 

Make sure to adjust any filters or columns as necessary based on your specific needs and database schema!

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the last flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Wednesday or the first flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Thursday, you'll need to utilize the `FLIGHT` table along with related tables to filter based on the required conditions. The SQL query below assumes appropriate JOINs based on the foreign key relationships in your schema.

Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
WITH Flights AS (
    SELECT 
        F.FLIGHT_ID,
        F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        F.AIRLINE_CODE,
        F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        F.FLIGHT_DAYS
    FROM 
        FLIGHT F
    JOIN 
        AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN 
        AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE 
        A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Oakland' AND 
        A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Salt Lake City' AND 
        F.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ('WED', 'THU')  -- Assuming that the days are represented suitably in your FLIGHT_DAYS column
)

SELECT 
    FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    AIRLINE_CODE,
    DEPARTURE_TIME,
    ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    Flights
WHERE 
    FLIGHT_DAYS = 'WED'
ORDER BY 
    DEPARTURE_TIME DESC  -- Last flight on Wednesday
LIMIT 1

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    AIRLINE_CODE,
    DEPARTURE_TIME,
    ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    Flights
WHERE 
    FLIGHT_DAYS = 'THU'
ORDER BY 
    DEPARTURE_TIME ASC  -- First flight on Thursday
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: We first create a CTE called `Flights` that selects flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City filtered by their `FLIGHT_DAYS`. This assumes you have a way to represent days in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column of the `FLIGHT` table.

2. **Queries for Both Days**:
   - For **Wednesday**: We retrieve the last flight by ordering the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in descending order and limiting it to 1.
   - For **Thursday**: We retrieve the first flight by ordering the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in ascending order and limiting it to 1.

3. **UNION ALL**: Combines the results of both sub-queries to provide the required flights.

Make sure to adapt the field names and filtering conditions when necessary based on your actual database schema and the specific representation of days in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` field.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the last flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City on a Wednesday, we need to join the relevant tables from your provided schema. We'll use the `FLIGHT` table to find flights, along with the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables to filter by the specific cities and airports. Additionally, we will filter the flights by the day of the week (Wednesday).

Here’s how the SQL query could look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE,
    F.FLIGHT_ID
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'WEDNESDAY'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: The columns chosen are the flight number, airline code, departure time, aircraft code sequence, and flight ID.
2. **FROM & JOIN**: 
   - We are starting from the `FLIGHT` table.
   - We are joining `AIRPORT` tables to match the flights' departure and arrival airports to their respective city names.
   - We join the `CITY` tables to filter by city names for Oakland and Salt Lake City.
   - We join the `DAYS` table to filter based on flight days.
3. **WHERE**: The conditions are set to find flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City on Wednesdays.
4. **ORDER BY**: We sort results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` in descending order to get the last flight.
5. **LIMIT**: We limit the results to just one entry, which would be the last flight.

Make sure to adjust any field names according to the specific database you are working with, if there are any discrepancies or naming conventions.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the last Wednesday flight from Oakland to Salt Lake City, we can formulate an SQL query based on the provided database schema. This query will need to join several tables: `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_STOP`, `CITY`, and `DAYS` to filter for flights, their stops, and the relevant days.

Assuming we have a way to determine the last Wednesday's date and that the `DAYS` table can be used to filter for Wednesday's flights, here's how the SQL might look:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       f.AIRLINE_CODE, 
       f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       fs.STOP_AIRPORT, 
       fs.ARRIVAL_AIRLINE, 
       fs.DEPARTURE_AIRLINE
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN FLIGHT_STOP fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY c_from ON a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = c_from.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY c_to ON a_to.CITY_CODE = c_to.CITY_CODE
JOIN DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE c_from.CITY_NAME = 'OAKLAND' 
  AND c_to.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
  AND d.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday'
  AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME = (
      SELECT MAX(f2.DEPARTURE_TIME)
      FROM FLIGHT f2 
      JOIN DAYS d2 ON d2.DAYS_CODE = f2.FLIGHT_DAYS
      WHERE d2.DAY_NAME = 'Wednesday' 
        AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = f.FROM_AIRPORT 
        AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = f.TO_AIRPORT
        AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- Ensures we get the last Wednesday
  )
ORDER BY f.DEPARTURE_TIME DESC;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Table Joins**: Multiple joins are used to fetch related entities (flight stops, departure and arrival airports, and cities).
2. **City Filters**: Filters cities by names: Oakland for departure and Salt Lake City for arrival.
3. **Day Filter**: Filters for flights that occurred on Wednesdays.
4. **Last Wednesday Logic**: A subquery fetches the maximum departure time from the flights that match the criteria on Wednesday, ensuring it is strictly in the past (`< CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`).

Be sure that the table names and fields match exactly with your database schema. The query assumes the dates are stored in a format that can be compared directly with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. Adjustments may be necessary based on field types and database behavior.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Milwaukee (MKE) to Indianapolis (IND) that departs on a Monday before 9:00 AM, you will need to join several tables based on your provided schema. The SQL query below demonstrates how to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE IN (f.FLIGHT_DAYS)
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' 
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT clause**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve: flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and airport names.
- **FROM clause**: Main table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `f`).
- **JOINs**: 
  - Join `AIRPORT` twice (aliased as `a1` and `a2`) to get the names of the departure and arrival airports.
  - Join on the `DAYS` table to filter flights for Mondays.
- **WHERE clause**: Filters:
  - Only flights departing from Milwaukee and arriving in Indianapolis.
  - Flights that are scheduled to depart on Mondays.
  - Ensures the departure time is before 9:00 AM.

Make sure the actual airport codes for Milwaukee and Indianapolis match their representation in your database or adjust the values in the `WHERE` clause accordingly.

To find a flight departing from Milwaukee to Indianapolis on a Monday before 8:00 AM, you'll need to look into the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to filter the relevant data based on your criteria. 

Assuming that you have the correct airport codes for Milwaukee and Indianapolis, here's an SQL query that could achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' AND
    c2.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' AND
    DATE_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%w') = 1 AND  -- 1 for Monday
    TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < '08:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, and airport names for both the departure and arrival airports.
2. **JOIN Clauses**: Joins `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables to filter based on city names and get the respective airport codes.
3. **WHERE Conditions**: Filters results by:
   - The city of departure being Milwaukee.
   - The destination city being Indianapolis.
   - The flight departure day being Monday (`DATE_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%w') = 1` where `%w` returns 0 for Sunday and 6 for Saturday).
   - The departure time being before 8:00 AM (`TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < '08:00:00'`).

Make sure to replace `DATE_FORMAT` function syntax if your SQL dialect requires a different method to extract the day of the week from the date.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers for flights departing from Oakland (OAK) to Salt Lake City (SLC) on Thursdays before 8:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes that the relevant tables in your database schema are properly related and that you are filtering based on the appropriate fields.

Here’s a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Oakland'   -- Oakland's airport name; ensure this matches your database
  AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Salt Lake City'  -- Salt Lake City's airport name; ensure this matches your database
  AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday'
  AND TIME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < '08:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- The `FLIGHT` table is aliased as `F`.
- You join `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` twice: once for the departure airport (Oakland) and once for the destination airport (Salt Lake City).
- You join with the `DAYS` table to filter only the flights that operate on Thursdays.
- Finally, you check that the departure time is before 8:00 AM using the `TIME()` function on the `DEPARTURE_TIME` column.

### Note:
- Replace `'Oakland'` and `'Salt Lake City'` with their respective airport names as they are listed in your `AIRPORT` table if they differ.
- Ensure that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` column is in a suitable format (such as `DATETIME` or `TIME`) in your database to correctly use it in the `WHERE` clause. If it's stored as a string, you might have to convert it first.

Question: list flights from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY before 6am thursday morning
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "OAKLAND" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights from Oakland to Salt Lake City before 6 AM on Thursday morning, you would need to construct an SQL query that joins the relevant tables and applies the appropriate filters.

Assuming that the "FROM_AIRPORT" and "TO_AIRPORT" fields in the FLIGHT table contain the airport codes for Oakland and Salt Lake City respectively, you'll also need to ensure that the filters for the day (Thursday) and time (before 6 AM) are correctly applied.

Here’s a hypothetical SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Oakland' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Salt Lake City' AND
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '06:00:00' AND
    f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%THURSDAY%'
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selection**: The query selects various flight details, including flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time, along with the names of the departure and destination airports.
2. **Joins**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice to find the names of the departure airport (Oakland) and destination airport (Salt Lake City).
3. **Filters**: 
   - The first filter checks if the departure airport name is 'Oakland'.
   - The second filter checks if the destination airport name is 'Salt Lake City'.
   - The third filter restricts departure times to be before 6 AM (06:00:00).
   - The fourth filter checks for flights that are operative on Thursday. The `FLIGHT_DAYS` field, which might be a string of days or codes (depending on your actual data), is filtered to include Thursday.

Make sure to adjust the airport names and format of `DEPARTURE_TIME` if your table uses a different format or if specific codes are actually used for filtering days.

Question: can you find me another flight from CINCINNATI to NEW YORK on saturday before 1800
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Cincinnati to New York on Saturday before 18:00, you'll need to join the relevant tables based on the routes and flight times. Assuming you have the airport codes for Cincinnati and New York, you'll refer to the `AIRPORT` table to get those airport codes. Then, you'll need to filter the `FLIGHT` table for the appropriate day of the week and the arrival time.

Here’s an example SQL query based on your schema:

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify the airport codes for Cincinnati and New York
SELECT
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_CODE AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    AIRPORT A1,
    AIRPORT A2
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%CINCINNATI%' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%';

-- Step 2: Utilize the identified airport codes to find flights
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%CINCINNATI%' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%NEW YORK%' AND
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' AND
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '18:00:00';
```

**Notes:**
1. Replace `LIKE` conditions with exact matches if you have the exact names for Cincinnati and New York airports. 
2. Ensure that the time format is consistent with your data in the `FLIGHT` table.
3. The query assumes that both `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` are stored in the `FLIGHT` table.
4. The `DAYS` table is used to check if the flight operates on Saturday by matching against `DAY_NAME`. 

Make sure you tailor the query with the specific codes or names as needed in your actual database!

    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '12:59:59'  -- Adjusted for time range around 12 PM
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects specific fields that provide information about the flight, including flight IDs, flight numbers, airline details, departure and arrival times, number of stops, connections, time elapsed, and fare details.
  
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates the main table to query, which is `FLIGHT` (aliased as `f`).

3. **JOINs**: 
   - Joins the `AIRLINE` table to get airline names.
   - Joins the `FARE` table to get fare costs.
   - Joins the `AIRPORT` table to get airport details for both departure and arrival.
   - Joins the `DAYS` table to filter based on the day of the week.

4. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters on the originating city as Indianapolis and the destination city as Cleveland.
   - Filters for flights specifically on Tuesday.
   - Filters for departures occurring around noon.

5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Orders the results by `DEPARTURE_TIME` to show flights in chronological order.

Make sure to replace any city names or field names based on your actual database if they vary. Also, if there are multiple entries or complex relationships, additional filtering logic might be necessary.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight and fare information for flights departing before 9:00 AM on Thursday from Oakland to Salt Lake City, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    fa.FARE_ID,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC' 
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME < '09:00:00' 
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM FLIGHT_DAYS fd 
        WHERE fd.FLIGHT_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID 
          AND fd.DAYS_CODE = (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Thursday')
    );
```

### Explanation:
- We're selecting relevant flight information (`FLIGHT_ID`, `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, etc.) and fare information (`FARE_ID`, `ONE_DIRECTION_COST`, `ROUND_TRIP_COST`).
- We join the `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` tables to get the needed details.
- The `FROM_AIRPORT` is filtered to 'OAK' (for Oakland) and the `TO_AIRPORT` is filtered to 'SLC' (for Salt Lake City).
- We check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` is before '09:00:00'.
- We also ensure that the flight is scheduled on a Thursday using a correlated subquery checking against the `FLIGHT_DAYS` table.

Make sure that the airport codes 'OAK' and 'SLC' correspond to your actual database values for Oakland and Salt Lake City, as the schema doesn’t define them explicitly. Adjust them if necessary based on your actual data.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flight and fare information for flights departing from Oakland (OAK) to Salt Lake City (SLC) before 8:00 AM on Thursdays, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes you have the necessary relationships and indexes set up in your database. Here’s how you can formulate your SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FARE.FARE_ID,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    FARE on FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE on FARE.FARE_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'OAK' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC' 
    AND FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00'
    AND FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS IN (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Thursday');
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, fare ID, and costs from the relevant tables.
- It ensures that the flight departs from Oakland (OAK) and arrives at Salt Lake City (SLC).
- The `FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00'` condition filters flights that depart before 8:00 AM.
- The query checks if the flight operates on Thursdays by ensuring the `DAYS_CODE` corresponds to Thursday from the `DAYS` table.

Make sure to adjust table and column names if they differ in your actual database schema. Additionally, if necessary, the date or time information may need further formatting depending on how timestamps are stored in your database (e.g., as datetime types).

Question: i need flight numbers and airlines for flights departing from OAKLAND to SALT LAKE CITY on thursday departing before 800
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flight numbers and airlines for flights departing from Oakland (OAK) to Salt Lake City (SLC) on Thursdays before 8:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. Note that we will need to join the relevant tables to filter by departure airport, arrival airport, departure time, and day of the week. 

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'OAKLAND' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Thursday' AND 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '08:00:00';
```

In this query:
- We are selecting the flight numbers and airline codes from the `FLIGHT` table (`F`).
- We join with the `AIRPORT` table twice to filter flights from Oakland (identified by `A1`) and to Salt Lake City (identified by `A2`).
- We join with the `DAYS` table to ensure we filter for Thursday flights.
- Finally, we check that the departure time is before 8 AM. 

Make sure to replace `'OAKLAND'` and `'SALT LAKE CITY'` with the exact values present in your database if they differ. The format of `DEPARTURE_TIME` assumes it's stored in a time format compatible with `'HH:MM:SS'`. Adjust it if necessary based on the actual data type in your database.

Question: list airports in ARIZONA NEVADA and CALIFORNIA please
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE ( ( STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "CALIFORNIA" OR STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "NEVADA" ) OR STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "ARIZONA" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list airports located in Arizona, Nevada, and California from the provided database schema, we can utilize the `AIRPORT` table, filtering the results by `STATE_CODE`. Assuming that the state codes for Arizona, Nevada, and California are 'AZ', 'NV', and 'CA' respectively, the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION, STATE_CODE, COUNTRY_NAME
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE STATE_CODE IN ('AZ', 'NV', 'CA');
```

This query will retrieve the airport code, name, location, state code, and country name for all airports that are located in the specified states. If you need additional fields, such as the time zone or minimum connect time, you can include those columns in the SELECT statement as appropriate.

Question: list CALIFORNIA NEVADA ARIZONA airports
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE ( ( STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "CALIFORNIA" OR STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "NEVADA" ) OR STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "ARIZONA" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports located in California, Nevada, and Arizona, you can use a SQL query that selects from the `AIRPORT` table filtering the states by their respective state codes. Assuming the state codes for California, Nevada, and Arizona are 'CA', 'NV', and 'AZ', respectively, the SQL query would be structured like this:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE STATE_CODE IN ('CA', 'NV', 'AZ');
```

This query selects the airport code, name, and location from the `AIRPORT` table where the state code is either 'CA', 'NV', or 'AZ'. Make sure to adjust the state codes if they are different in your actual database schema.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION

Question: list airports in NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the airports in New York from the given database schema, you would typically perform a SQL query that filters the airports based on the state code associated with New York. Given the schema, you would likely join the `AIRPORT` and `STATE` tables to find the airports that are located in New York.

Here's an SQL query to accomplish that:

```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE, AIRPORT_NAME, AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE STATE_CODE = 'NY';  -- Assuming 'NY' is the state code for New York
```

Make sure you replace `'NY'` with the actual state code from the `STATE` table if it differs. This query selects the airport code, name, and location for all airports identified with the state code that corresponds to New York.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a ticket from Nashville, Tennessee, to Seattle, we need to perform several steps in the query. These include finding the airport codes for Nashville and Seattle, retrieving available flights between these airports, and their corresponding fares.

Here's an SQL query that summarizes this process:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find the airport codes for Nashville and Seattle
WITH AirportCodes AS (
    SELECT 
        a.AIRPORT_CODE AS NASHVILLE_AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM 
        AIRPORT a
    JOIN 
        CITY c ON a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c.CITY_CODE
    WHERE 
        c.CITY_NAME = 'Nashville' 
        AND c.STATE_CODE = (SELECT STATE_CODE FROM STATE WHERE STATE_NAME = 'Tennessee')
    
    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        a.AIRPORT_CODE AS SEATTLE_AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM 
        AIRPORT a
    JOIN 
        CITY c ON a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = c.CITY_CODE
    WHERE 
        c.CITY_NAME = 'Seattle' 
        AND c.STATE_CODE = (SELECT STATE_CODE FROM STATE WHERE STATE_NAME = 'Washington')
),

-- Step 2: Retrieve available flights and their fares from Nashville to Seattle
AvailableFlights AS (
    SELECT 
        f.FLIGHT_ID, 
        f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
        f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
        f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        f.FROM_AIRPORT,
        f.TO_AIRPORT,
        ff.FARE_ID,
        fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
        fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST 
    FROM 
        FLIGHT f
    INNER JOIN 
        FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
    INNER JOIN 
        FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
    WHERE 
        f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT NASHVILLE_AIRPORT_CODE FROM AirportCodes WHERE ROWNUM = 1) AND
        f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT SEATTLE_AIRPORT_CODE FROM AirportCodes WHERE ROWNUM = 1)
)

-- Step 3: Fetch the results
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    AvailableFlights f
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:

1. **AirportCodes CTE**: This Common Table Expression fetches the airport codes for Nashville and Seattle based on the city names and state codes.

2. **AvailableFlights CTE**: This CTE retrieves flight details, including the flight number, departure and arrival times, and fare costs between the specified airport codes from the previous CTE.

3. **Final Selection**: The main query selects the relevant flight information ordered by departure time.

Make sure to adjust any specific table names or field formats based on your actual database configuration if they differ from those provided in the schema. Also, verify the availability of data in the required tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Ontario California to Orlando, you would typically use a SQL query that joins the relevant tables based on the flight information, airport codes, and possibly other filtering conditions. Assuming that the airports for Ontario California and Orlando are identified by their respective airport codes, you would first need to know these codes. However, I will write the SQL query assuming the airport codes are known.

Here’s an example SQL query that retrieves flights from Ontario California (for example, using `ONT` as the airport code) to Orlando (`MCO` as the airport code):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ONT' AND
    F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO';
```

In this query:
- We select relevant flight details such as the flight number, airline name, departure time, arrival time, number of stops, and total time elapsed.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the flights to only include those departing from Ontario (ONT) and arriving in Orlando (MCO).

Make sure to replace `ONT` and `MCO` with the actual airport codes for Ontario, California, and Orlando if they are different.

Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Ontario, California to Orlando, you would need to join several tables based on their relationships to find relevant flight details. Below is an example SQL query that retrieves the flights from Ontario, California (ONT) to Orlando (MCO):

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ONTARIO CALIFORNIA' AND 
    A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'ORLANDO';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
- The `FLIGHT` table is the primary table that contains flight information.
- We join the `AIRPORT` table twice:
  - The first join (`A1`) matches the departure airport (Ontario, California).
  - The second join (`A2`) matches the destination airport (Orlando).
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights departing from Ontario, California, and arriving in Orlando.

### Note:
- Make sure to replace `'ONTARIO CALIFORNIA'` and `'ORLANDO'` with the actual airport codes if available, as the specific airport code will usually yield better results. For example, Ontario International Airport's airport code is `ONT` and Orlando International Airport's code is `MCO`. Adjust accordingly if those details are included in your database schema.

To retrieve flight information for a one-way ticket from Milwaukee to Orlando either on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning, you would need to join several tables in your database, including the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `CITY`, and possibly others, to filter for the desired conditions. Here's a SQL query that achieves that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO' 
    AND (
        (DAYOFWEEK(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 4 AND HOUR(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 17) OR  -- Wednesday evening (4: Thursday in some SQL)
        (DAYOFWEEK(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) = 5 AND HOUR(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 12)    -- Thursday morning
    )
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query joins the necessary tables to get flight information along with the departure and arrival airports.
- It filters flights where the departure city is Milwaukee and the arrival city is Orlando.
- It checks if the departure time is during Wednesday evening (assumed to be after 5 PM) or Thursday morning (before noon).
- Adjustments to the `DAYOFWEEK` function may depend on the specific SQL dialect, so please verify if it works as expected according to your SQL server.
- Finally, it orders the results by departure time, which helps to see the earliest option fitting the criteria. 

Please adapt any parts of the query, such as function names or date formats, as necessary based on the particular SQL dialect you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

To retrieve all round trip flights from Burbank to Seattle that arrive before 19:00 in Seattle, we can use the following SQL query. The query relies on the relevant tables in the schema you've provided, specifically the `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables.

We'll assume the airport codes for Burbank and Seattle are "BUR" and "SEA", respectively, but you can replace them with the actual airport codes used in your database.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR'  -- Burbank Airport Code
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SEA'  -- Seattle Airport Code
    AND F.RETURN_FLIGHT IS NOT NULL  -- Check for round trip flights
    AND DATE_PART('hour', F.ARRIVAL_TIME) < 19;  -- Arrive before 19:00 in Seattle
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM**: We're selecting from the `FLIGHT` table (aliased as `F`) and we also join the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for each airport) to filter based on the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT`.
- **JOIN ON**: Joins connect the flights to their respective departure and arrival airports.
- **WHERE**: We're filtering for flights from Burbank (`A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BUR'`) to Seattle (`A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'SEA'`), checking if it's a round trip flight (`F.RETURN_FLIGHT IS NOT NULL`), and ensuring that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is before 19:00 in Seattle.
- **DATE_PART('hour', F.ARRIVAL_TIME)**: This checks the hour of the arrival time to ensure it's before 19:00.
  
Note: Make sure to adapt the query to your database's specific structure, especially the condition for round trip flights and how times are represented. If your schema does not include a flag to indicate round trips, you'll need to modify accordingly. Also, if `ARRIVAL_TIME` is stored in a specific time zone or format, you might need additional handling for time zone conversions.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest economy flights from Miami to New York, you will need to consider the relevant tables that contain information about flights, fares, and the airports involved. The query below assumes the airport codes for Miami and New York as `MIA` and `JFK` respectively. However, these codes might vary based on the specific AIports you are considering in New York (like JFK, LGA, or EWR). 

If you want to be more inclusive in searching different airports in New York, you could change the conditions accordingly. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS FB ON FA.FARE_BASIS_CODE = FB.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MIA' 
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR') -- Change based on the desired airports in NY
    AND FB.BOOKING_CLASS = 'Economy'
ORDER BY 
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 5; -- Limiting to the top 5 cheapest flights
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We're selecting relevant columns for flight information and fare costs.
- **FROM**: We're starting from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOIN**: We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` to link flights with their fares and then join `FARE` and `FARE_BASIS` to access the detailed fare information.
- **WHERE**: We filter for flights that depart from Miami and arrive at any of the specified New York airports, only considering economy class fares.
- **ORDER BY**: This sorts the results based on one-way fare cost in ascending order to get the cheapest options.
- **LIMIT**: We limit the result to the top 5 cheapest flights.

Adjust the airport codes as necessary to fit the specific query context.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Milwaukee (city) to Atlanta (city) that depart before 10:00 AM on a daily basis, you will need to perform a join operation on the key tables related to flights, cities, and airports. Additionally, you will have to apply a filter for the flight's departure time.

Here's a SQL query that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = AS1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = AS2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'Milwaukee' 
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'Atlanta'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME < '10:00:00'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%D%'  -- Assuming the '%' indicates daily flights.
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including airline code, flight number, departure and arrival times, and the names of the departure and arrival airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: 
   - `FLIGHT F`: Use the flight table as the main table.
   - The query joins the `AIRPORT` table twice (as `A1` and `A2`) to get the names of the airports for departures and arrivals.
   - Joins with the `CITY` table to match city names with their respective airport locations.

3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filters for flights departing from Milwaukee to Atlanta.
   - Filters for departure times before 10:00 AM.
   - Checks if the flight operates daily (assuming daily flights are represented by 'D' in the `FLIGHT_DAYS` column).

4. **ORDER BY Clause**: Orders the result by `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

### Note:

Make sure to replace any missing join criteria or details based on your specific database schema and relationships if they differ from the assumption above. Also check to ensure the relative naming conventions and data types align with your database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights and fares from Toronto to St. Petersburg using the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes the airport codes for Toronto and St. Petersburg have been previously identified. For the purposes of this example, let's assume the airport codes are 'YYZ' for Toronto (Toronto Pearson International Airport) and 'LED' for St. Petersburg (Pulkovo Airport).

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN
    FARE_FLIGHT ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FARE_FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FARE_FLIGHT.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'YYZ' 
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'LED'
    AND FLIGHT.STOPS = 0;  -- Assuming that STOPS indicates the number of stops, where 0 means nonstop
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects the airline information, flight number, departure and arrival times, and fare costs for nonstop flights from Toronto to St. Petersburg.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to access fare details for the selected flights.
- The `WHERE` clause filters for flights that depart from 'YYZ' (Toronto Pearson International Airport) and arrive at 'LED' (Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg), while also ensuring there are no stops (`STOPS = 0`).

### Notes:
- Ensure that the airport codes used in the query reflect what's in your database.
- If you need to include additional details such as flight duration or specific attributes about the flights, you can extend the `SELECT` clause accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for weekday flights from Milwaukee (MKE) to Orlando (MCO) one way, you need to join several tables to get the relevant details. You may want to filter for flights on Monday through Friday, which are typically the weekdays.

Here's an SQL query that should meet your requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    FA.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    D.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE IN (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DATE_DAY WHERE DAY_NAME IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday'))
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MKE'
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', D.DAYS_CODE, '%')
    AND FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N';  -- Assuming 'N' indicates one-way flights
```

### Explanation:
1. **Tables Used**:
   - **FLIGHT**: To retrieve flight details.
   - **AIRLINE**: To get the names of the airlines.
   - **FARE**: To get fare information including the cost.
   - **DAYS**: To filter by weekdays.

2. **JOINs**: The tables are joined based on common keys (`AIRLINE_CODE` and `FLIGHT_ID`).

3. **Filtering**: 
   - The `FROM_AIRPORT` is set to 'MKE' (Milwaukee) and `TO_AIRPORT` is set to 'MCO' (Orlando).
   - The sequence in `FLIGHT_DAYS` is checked against weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - Ensures that it is a one-way flight based on `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`.

4. **Wildcard in `FLIGHT_DAYS`**: This assumes that `FLIGHT_DAYS` is a string containing codes for days; thus, it uses a wildcard search.

### Note: 
Make sure that the underlying assumptions (like the structure of `FLIGHT_DAYS` and the values for `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED`) are correct according to your actual database schema. Adjust the query as necessary based on the specific data types and content.

To fetch weekday flights from Milwaukee to Orlando that are one-way, you will need to join several tables in your database: specifically the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `DATE_DAY` tables to identify the relevant flights, their timings, and other necessary details. Here’s how your SQL query might look:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.STOPS,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS FROM_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS FROM_CITY ON FROM_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = FROM_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY AS TO_CITY ON TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE = TO_CITY.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FARE.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE ON FLIGHT_FARE.FARE_ID = FARE.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY ON FLIGHT.FLIGHT_DAYS = DATE_DAY.DAY_NAME -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS uses DAY_NAME
WHERE 
    FROM_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'MILWAUKEE' 
    AND TO_CITY.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
    AND DATE_DAY.DAY_NAME IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday') 
    AND FARE.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'N'; -- Assuming 'N' means one-way
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **SELECT**: We're selecting the relevant columns, including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and one-direction cost.
   
2. **JOINs**: 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with `AIRPORT` to get the departure and arrival airports.
   - The `CITY` table is joined with each airport table to get the corresponding cities.
   - We join the `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` tables to fetch pricing details.
   - The `DATE_DAY` table is joined to filter only those records that correspond to weekdays.

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - We filter results to ensure the departure is from Milwaukee and the arrival is in Orlando.
   - We specify that we want flights on weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - Finally, we ensure that we are only considering one-way flights by checking that the round trip required is 'N'.

Make sure to adjust any field names or table relationships if there are discrepancies in your actual database schema.

Question: list LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list information regarding Los Angeles based on your database schema, we need to query the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables, as Los Angeles is a city and also has associated airports. Below is an SQL query that retrieves the relevant data for Los Angeles from the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables.

```sql
SELECT 
    CITY.CITY_CODE,
    CITY.CITY_NAME,
    CITY.STATE_CODE,
    CITY.COUNTRY_NAME,
    CITY.TIME_ZONE_CODE,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_LOCATION,
    AIRPORT.MINIMUM_CONNECT_TIME
FROM 
    CITY
LEFT JOIN 
    AIRPORT ON CITY.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    CITY.CITY_NAME = 'LOS ANGELES';
```

This query selects various fields from both the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables where the city name matches "LOS ANGELES". Adjustments may be needed based on the actual data and how the `AIRPORT` table relates to the `CITY` table in your implementation (e.g., if there’s a specific mapping for cities to airports). 

If you need to include more specific information, please specify, and I can adjust the query accordingly!

Question: list LOS ANGELES
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "LOS ANGELES" ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list information related to "Los Angeles" from the database schema provided, you would typically want to query the `CITY` table for the city name. Additionally, if you want to obtain more information, such as airports in Los Angeles or other related entities, you'll involve other tables too. Below is a basic SQL query to list the city "Los Angeles".

### SQL Query to List Los Angeles from the CITY Table:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Los Angeles';
```

### SQL Query to List Airports in Los Angeles:
If you want to find specific airports located in Los Angeles, you can join the `CITY` table with the `AIRPORT` and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables. Here’s an example:

```sql
SELECT A.AIRPORT_NAME, A.AIRPORT_CODE, A.AIRPORT_LOCATION
FROM AIRPORT A
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE ASERVICE ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = ASERVICE.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C ON ASERVICE.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE C.CITY_NAME = 'Los Angeles';
```

### Additional Information:
Depending on what else you might want, you could extend these queries to include related information from `AIRLINE`, `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, etc., by joining the respective tables as needed.

Question: list flights from LGA to BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from LGA (LaGuardia Airport) to BURBANK (Bob Hope Airport), you would need to join the relevant tables from your database schema. Specifically, you would likely join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to filter for flights departing from LGA and arriving at BURBANK.

Here’s the SQL query to retrieve the flights from LGA to BURBANK:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' 
    AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BURBANK';
```

This query selects various flight details including the flight ID, flight number, airline code, names of the departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and total time elapsed, where the flight originates from LGA and finishes at BURBANK. 

Make sure to replace 'BURBANK' with the actual airport code if it's something other than 'BURBANK', as airport codes can often be unique, and you may want to confirm the exact code used within your database.

To list flights from Indianapolis to Memphis along with fares on a Monday, you would need to join several tables in the database schema provided. Here’s an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fa.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fa.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fa ON ff.FARE_ID = fa.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON d.DAYS_CODE = f.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' AND
    a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MEMPHIS' AND
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Monday';
```

### Explanation:
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: Starts from the `FLIGHT` table and aliases it as `f`.
- **JOIN AIRPORT a_from**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice to get the departure airport (Indianapolis) and destination airport (Memphis).
- **JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff**: Joins to the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to associate fares with flights.
- **JOIN FARE fa**: Joins to the `FARE` table to get the cost details.
- **JOIN DAYS d**: This joins the `DAYS` table to ensure we focus on flights that operate on a specific day, in this case, Monday.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results for flights that start from Indianapolis and go to Memphis, executing only for flights on Monday.

Make sure that the names used in the `WHERE` clause match the exact names in the `AIRPORT` table. Adjust them accordingly if needed.

To retrieve flights and fares for a trip from Miami to Cleveland on a Wednesday, you'll need to join several tables from your database schema: specifically, the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `CITY`, and `FLIGHT_FARE` tables. Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE

SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME IN ( SELECT DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NAME FROM DATE_DAY AS DATE_DAYalias0 WHERE DATE_DAYalias0.DAY_NUMBER = day_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.MONTH_NUMBER = month_number0 AND DATE_DAYalias0.YEAR = year0 ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list flights from Charlotte on Saturday afternoon, you will need to join several tables based on the relationships defined in your database schema. Here's how you can formulate the SQL query:

1. Identify the airport code for Charlotte by joining the CITY and AIRPORT tables.
2. Determine which days correspond to Saturday using the DAYS table.
3. Filter the flights that are scheduled to depart in the afternoon, typically considered as any time from 12:00 PM (noon) to 5:59 PM.
4. Join the relevant tables to get the desired output.

Here's an example SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    C.CITY_NAME,
    D.DAY_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C ON A.AIRPORT_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    C.CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12
    AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Selects relevant columns such as flight number, airline code, departure and arrival time, and airport name.
- **JOINs**: Combines the FLIGHT table with the AIRPORT and CITY tables to get the airport details and geographic information. It also joins with the DAYS table to filter by day of the week.
- **WHERE Conditions**:
  - Checks if the city is Charlotte.
  - Ensures the day is Saturday.
  - Filters for flights departing in the afternoon by checking the hour component of the `DEPARTURE_TIME`.

Ensure that your SQL environment supports the `EXTRACT` function used for getting the hour from the time. Adjust the query according to your specific SQL dialect if necessary.

Question: list type of aircraft for all flights from CHARLOTTE
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.BASIC_TYPE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE IN ( SELECT EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the types of aircraft for all flights departing from CHARLOTTE, you first need to identify the airport code associated with CHARLOTTE. In this case, you'll use the `AIRPORT` table to find that information. Once you have the airport code, you can then join several tables to retrieve the aircraft types for those flights.

Here's a sample SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, 
    A.MANUFACTURER, 
    A.BASIC_TYPE, 
    A.WIDE_BODY 
FROM 
    AIRPORT AS AP
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS F ON AP.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT
JOIN 
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS ES ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT AS A ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE 
    AP.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%CHARLOTTE%'
```

### Explanation:
- `AIRPORT AS AP`: We are selecting from the `AIRPORT` table to identify the airport codes for CHARLOTTE.
- `JOIN FLIGHT AS F ON AP.AIRPORT_CODE = F.FROM_AIRPORT`: We join with the `FLIGHT` table to get the flights that depart from the identified airport code.
- `JOIN EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS ES ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE`: This join retrieves the corresponding equipment (aircraft) for the flights.
- `JOIN AIRCRAFT AS A ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE`: Finally, we join with the `AIRCRAFT` table to get the details of the actual aircraft.
- `WHERE AP.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%CHARLOTTE%'`: This clause filters the results to only those airports with "CHARLOTTE" in their name.

This will return a list of distinct aircraft descriptions, manufacturers, basic types, and whether they are wide-body or not, for all flights departing from the CHARLOTTE airport. Adjust the `LIKE` condition accordingly if you have specific airport codes for CHARLOTTE.

Raw LLM Response:
To list the flights and fares from Tacoma to Orlando for a round trip leaving on Saturday and returning the next Saturday, you need to join the relevant tables while applying the necessary filters for the specific cities, flight days, and the round-trip condition. Below is an example SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS DEPARTURE_DATE,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS ARRIVAL_DATE,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE,
    fare.FARE_AIRLINE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT from_airport ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = from_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT to_airport ON f.TO_AIRPORT = to_airport.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY from_city ON from_airport.AIRPORT_LOCATION = from_city.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY to_city ON to_airport.AIRPORT_LOCATION = to_city.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    from_city.CITY_NAME = 'TACOMA'
    AND to_city.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%' || (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'SATURDAY') || '%'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y'
    AND fare.RESTRICTION_CODE IS NULL
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: Selects from the `FLIGHT` table, which contains information about flights.
2. **JOINs**: 
   - Joins `FARE` to get fare information for each flight.
   - Joins `AIRPORT` to match the airport codes with airport locations for departure and arrival.
   - Joins `CITY` to filter flights departing from Tacoma and arriving in Orlando.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights specifically going from "TACOMA" to "ORLANDO".
   - Filters for flights that operate on Saturdays.
   - Ensures that it is a round-trip flight by checking the requirement in `FARE`.
   - Optionally checks for any restrictions (which can be adapted based on your needs).
   
### Note:
- Depending on your SQL dialect (PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.), you may need to adjust the string concatenation syntax.
- Ensure that the exact structure of the database schema matches what is represented in this query, particularly the relationships and key columns.

Question: list seating capacities of DL flights from SEATTLE to SALT LAKE CITY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE IN ( SELECT EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "DL" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the seating capacities of Delta Airlines (identified by the airline code 'DL') flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. The relevant tables will include `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRCRAFT` to access the necessary information.

Here is an SQL query that accomplishes that:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    FL.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    AC.CAPACITY
FROM 
    FLIGHT FL
JOIN 
    AIRLINE AL ON FL.AIRLINE_CODE = AL.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_FROM ON FL.FROM_AIRPORT = AP_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AP_TO ON FL.TO_AIRPORT = AP_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE ES ON FL.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT AC ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = AC.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE 
    AL.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'
    AND AP_FROM.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SEATTLE'
    AND AP_TO.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We select the aircraft description, flight number, and seating capacity.
- **FROM**: We begin with the `FLIGHT` table as it contains the information about specific flights.
- **JOIN**: We join various tables to obtain corresponding data:
  - Join `AIRLINE` to filter for Delta flights by their airline code.
  - Join `AIRPORT` to filter for flights originating from Seattle and arriving in Salt Lake City.
  - Join `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` to access the aircraft used for each flight.
  - Join `AIRCRAFT` to get the seating capacities for the aircraft.
- **WHERE**: Apply conditions to filter Delta flights between Seattle and Salt Lake City.

Make sure the airport names in your database match exactly with the conditions provided in the `WHERE` clause. If you're using airport codes instead of names, adjust the query accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a list of Delta Airlines (DL) flights from Seattle to Salt Lake City along with the aircraft type used for each flight, you would need to join several tables in the database schema. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    AIRCRAFT.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION,
    AIRCRAFT.MANUFACTURER,
    AIRCRAFT.BASIC_TYPE
FROM
    FLIGHT
JOIN
    AIRCRAFT ON FLIGHT.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE ON FLIGHT.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
WHERE
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'
    AND FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA'  -- Seattle Airport Code
    AND FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC';    -- Salt Lake City Airport Code
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT clause**: Specifies the columns to retrieve, including flight details and aircraft information.
2. **FROM clause**: Specifies the main table, `FLIGHT`, to query flight information.
3. **JOIN clauses**: Joins the `AIRCRAFT` table using `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` to connect flight information to the type of aircraft.
4. **WHERE clause**: Filters the results to include only Delta Airlines flights (`AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'`) and flights from Seattle (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA'`) to Salt Lake City (`TO_AIRPORT = 'SLC'`).

Make sure to adjust any specific table or field names as necessary based on your actual database schema and constraints.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve round trip flights from Cleveland to Miami for next Wednesday, you'll first need to identify the relevant tables in your database schema. The main tables you will work with are `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and any related tables that can provide the necessary details and constraints regarding the flights.

Assuming that CLEVELAND corresponds to its airport code (e.g., CLE) and MIAMI corresponds to its airport code (e.g., MIA), the SQL query could look like this. Also, you need to ensure you know the date for "next Wednesday." Supposing today's date is a Monday (which is often the case when such SQL queries are prepared), next Wednesday will be two days from now.

Here's an SQL query to fetch the required information:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE -- Assuming same airline for return.
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID IN (SELECT ff.FARE_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE ff WHERE ff.FLIGHT_ID IN (f1.FLIGHT_ID, f2.FLIGHT_ID))
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f1.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' AND 
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'MIAMI' AND 
    f1.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%' AND  -- Assuming 'W' is the code for Wednesday
    f2.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%W%' AND
    DATE(f1.DEPARTURE_TIME) = CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '2' DAY
    AND DATE(f2.DEPARTURE_TIME) = CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '9' DAY; -- Assuming round trip returns in a week.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Flights**: We are selecting outbound and return flights with details such as flight ID, flight number, departure time, and arrival time.
2. **Joins**: We join the flight table to itself for the return journey and join with the fare table to get the fare details.
3. **Filters**:
   - We filter the outbound flight to only those flying from Cleveland to Miami on the specified day (next Wednesday).
   - We filter the return flight similarly, assuming a return one week later.

### Note:
- Replace `'CLEVELAND'` and `'MIAMI'` with the actual airport codes (like 'CLE', 'MIA') if you have the codes available.
- Customize the date logic appropriately based on your database handling of dates and the specific format used in your DB.
- The condition for ROUND_TRIP (return flight date, connections, etc.) may need adjustments based on actual requirements or availability in the schema.

To retrieve the fares for round trip flights from Cleveland to Miami for next Wednesday, you would need to perform a SQL query that joins several tables in the schema. Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- Define a variable for next Wednesday's date
WITH NextWednesday AS (
    SELECT DATEADD(DAY, (7 - DATEPART(WEEKDAY, GETDATE()) + 3) % 7, GETDATE()) AS FlightDate
)

SELECT 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT,
    FA.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON F.FLIGHT_ID = FF.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE FA ON FF.FARE_ID = FA.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A_FROM.CITY_CODE = 'CLEVELAND' 
    AND A_TO.CITY_CODE = 'MIAMI'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN (SELECT FlightDate FROM NextWednesday) AND (SELECT FlightDate FROM NextWednesday) + '23:59' 
    AND FA.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = 'Y';
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `NextWednesday` CTE calculates the date for next Wednesday by determining the current weekday and adding the necessary number of days.

2. **Main Query**: 
   - Select fields such as the airline code, flight number, from and to airports, and the round trip cost.
   - Join the necessary tables:
     - `FLIGHT` to get flight details.
     - `FLIGHT_FARE` to associate flight IDs with fares.
     - `FARE` to obtain the fare details including the round trip cost.
     - `AIRPORT` twice to decode the airport codes into city names.
   
3. **WHERE Clause**: 
   - Filter to ensure the departure is from Cleveland to Miami.
   - Check that the `DEPARTURE_TIME` falls within the next Wednesday date range.
   - Ensure that the round trip is required by checking the fare's `ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED` field.

Please adjust the table names and column names according to your actual database schema if they differ. The query might need modification based on how dates and times are stored in your database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the fares for flights from Miami to Cleveland for the next Sunday, we need to join several tables in the database schema, specifically the `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and `AIRPORT` tables. In addition, we would also reference the `DATE_DAY` and `DAYS` tables to filter the results for the specific day of the week. 

Below is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    d.DAY_NAME,
    fl.DEPARTURE_TIME
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT fl ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY d ON d.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday'
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Miami' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'Cleveland' 
    AND d.YEAR = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) 
    AND d.MONTH_NUMBER = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE) 
    AND d.DAY_NUMBER = (DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL (7 - DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE) + 1) % 7 DAY));
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- We select relevant columns, including fare details, airport names, and the day of the flight.
- We join the `FARE`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT` tables to get the required information based on the relationships.
- The `DATE_DAY` table is used to filter for "Sunday."
- The WHERE clause filters for the `FROM_AIRPORT` being Miami and `TO_AIRPORT` being Cleveland.
- The calculation for the next Sunday is handled in the WHERE clause to ensure we are getting the correct dates.

Make sure to adjust the current date logic to match your system's SQL syntax and functions as required.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights departing early Saturday morning from Chicago to Seattle that are nonstop and include meal service, you can construct the following SQL query. Assume you have the relevant data in the tables as described in the schema provided.

Here’s how the SQL query would look:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION,
    A.AIRLINE_NAME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE FS ON F.MEAL_CODE = FS.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'SEATTLE')
    AND F.STOPS = 0  -- Nonstop flights
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '05:00:00' AND '12:00:00' -- Early Saturday morning
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT Statement**: Specifies the fields you want to retrieve, such as flight number, departure time, arrival time, meal description, and airline name.
- **JOIN Clauses**: 
  - `JOIN AIRLINE` connects the FLIGHT table to the AIRLINE table to get airline names.
  - `JOIN FOOD_SERVICE` connects to get descriptions of meals provided on the flights.
  - `JOIN DAYS` helps filter the flights that operate specifically on Saturdays.
- **WHERE Clause**: 
  - Filters for flights departing from Chicago to Seattle, ensuring that it is a nonstop flight (i.e., `F.STOPS = 0`).
  - It checks that the flight's departure day is Saturday and that the departure time is within the specified early morning range (from 5 AM to noon).
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts results by departure time.

Make sure to adjust any city or airport names to match your data exactly as they appear in the database.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Chicago to Seattle on Saturday morning that have meal services, you can construct the SQL query using the provided schema. Here’s a sample SQL query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = 'CITY_CHICAGO' AND   -- Replace with actual city code for Chicago
    a2.CITY_CODE = 'CITY_SEATTLE' AND    -- Replace with actual city code for Seattle
    d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' AND
    TIME_FORMAT(f.DEPARTURE_TIME, '%H') BETWEEN '06' AND '11' -- Morning flights
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Fields**: The query selects flight details including the flight ID, flight number, departure and arrival times, airport names, and meal descriptions.
  
2. **Joining Tables**: It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure and once for the arrival) to get the airport names. It also joins with `FOOD_SERVICE` to ensure meals are available on these flights.

3. **Filters**:
   - It filters for flights departing from Chicago and arriving in Seattle. Here, you will need to replace `'CITY_CHICAGO'` and `'CITY_SEATTLE'` with the actual city codes from your `CITY` table.
   - It specifies to only include flights that occur on Saturday (`d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'`).
   - It checks if the departure time is in the morning (between 6 AM and 11 AM).

4. **Ordering**: Finally, it orders the results by departure time.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual city codes for Chicago and Seattle as per your `CITY` table. Also ensure that the time format in your database is compatible with the specified format in the WHERE clause.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the Saturday morning flights with meals from Chicago to Minneapolis, you would need to ensure that you filter the flights based on the departure location, arrival location, day of the week, and that the flights include meal services. Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this task based on the provided database schema:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,

    AND TIME(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '12:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: We select the flight number, departure and arrival times, airline code, and meal description.
2. **JOIN Operations**:
   - We join the `FLIGHT` table with `FOOD_SERVICE` on the `MEAL_CODE` to get meal descriptions.
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table to get details for departure and arrival airports.
   - We join with the `DAYS` table to filter flights that are scheduled on 'Saturday'.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights departing from Chicago and arriving in Minneapolis.
   - Ensures that the day is Saturday.
   - Limits results to morning flights (departures between 6 AM and 12 PM).
4. **ORDER BY**: Orders the results by departure time for better readability. 

Make sure to adapt any specific naming conventions or requirements based on your actual database setup for case sensitivity (e.g., `F.FLIGHT_NUMBER` vs `f.flight_number`).

Question: give me flights from SEATTLE to CHICAGO that have meals on CO
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "CHICAGO" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SEATTLE" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "CO" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Seattle (SEA) to Chicago (CHI) that also include meals coded as "CO," you need to join multiple tables in your SQL query. The tables you'll typically join are `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, `FOOD_SERVICE`, and possibly `AIRPORT` to ensure you're filtering correctly by airport codes.

Here's an example SQL query for this request:

```sql
SELECT f.FLIGHT_ID,
       f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
       f.AIRLINE_CODE,
       f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
       f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
       fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN FARE fare ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE fs ON f.MEAL_CODE = fs.MEAL_CODE
WHERE f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SEA'
  AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'CHI'
  AND fs.MEAL_CODE = 'CO';
```

### Explanation:
- **`FLIGHT f`**: Selects from the `FLIGHT` table, using alias `f`.
- **`FARE fare`**: Joins the `FARE` table to access fare-related details, using alias `fare`.
- **`FLIGHT_FARE ff`**: Joins the `FLIGHT_FARE` table to link fares with flights, using alias `ff`.
- **`FOOD_SERVICE fs`**: Joins the `FOOD_SERVICE` table to access meal information, using alias `fs`.
- **`WHERE`**: Filters the results to include only flights departing from Seattle (SEA) to Chicago (CHI) and which serve meals with the code 'CO'.

Make sure to adjust the names of the fields if they differ in your database schema. Additionally, ensure that any constraints or relationships in your schema (such as foreign keys) are properly respected in the joins.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest round trip flights from Indianapolis (IND) to Orlando (MCO) around December 25th, we will need to join several tables in the database schema to gather all required information about the flights, fares, and relevant conditions. Below is an SQL query that aims to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON fare.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MCO' AND fare.TO_AIRPORT = 'IND'
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = ff2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare2 ON ff2.FARE_ID = fare2.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'IND'
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MCO'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '2023-12-25 00:00:00' AND '2023-12-26 00:00:00'
    AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '2023-12-27 00:00:00' AND '2023-12-28 00:00:00'
ORDER BY 
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM and JOIN clauses**: We are joining various tables like `FLIGHT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, and `FARE` to fetch details regarding the outbound and return flights.
2. **WHERE clause**: The conditions ensure that we only consider flights from Indianapolis (IND) to Orlando (MCO) departing around December 25, 2023, and flights returning from Orlando to Indianapolis around December 27-28, 2023.
3. **ORDER BY clause**: We order the result by `ROUND_TRIP_COST` in ascending order to find the cheapest option.
4. **LIMIT clause**: This limits the result to just the cheapest option.

Make sure to replace the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` values according to their correct airport codes from your `AIRPORT` table if they differ. Additionally, adjust the datetime format in the conditions according to your SQL database's date format.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest one-way fare from Indianapolis to Orlando on December 27, we will need to join several tables from your database schema. The relevant tables would include `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and potentially `CITY`. We will look for the one-way fare that has the lowest cost on that specific date.

Here's the SQL query to achieve that:

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Cheapest_One_Way_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
JOIN FLIGHT fl ON ff.FLIGHT_ID = fl.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON fl.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON fl.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY c1 ON a1.CITY_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN CITY c2 ON a2.CITY_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
WHERE c1.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS'
  AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'ORLANDO'
  AND fl.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '2023-12-27 00:00:00' AND '2023-12-27 23:59:59';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Selecting Minimum Fare**: We use `MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST)` to find the cheapest one-way fare.
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - `FARE` is joined to `FLIGHT_FARE` to relate fares to flights.
   - `FLIGHT_FARE` is then joined to `FLIGHT` to access the flight details.
   - `FLIGHT` is joined to `AIRPORT` twice to get the departure airport (FROM_AIRPORT) and destination airport (TO_AIRPORT).
   - `AIRPORT` is joined to `CITY` to filter by city names.
3. **City Filtering**: We filter for Indianapolis as the departure city and Orlando as the destination city.
4. **Date Filtering**: We filter the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to be within the entire day of December 27, 2023.

This query assumes that the database system understands the date format and the particular syntax used. Adjustments might be necessary based on your specific SQL dialect.

Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is a fare from Pittsburgh (PIT) to Cleveland that is under 200 dollars, you will need to write an SQL query that retrieves fares associated with flights between these two airports. Here’s how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT FARE.FARE_ID, FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST, FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM FARE
JOIN AIRPORT ON FARE.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AS TO_AIRPORT ON FARE.TO_AIRPORT = TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'PITTSBURGH' 
  AND TO_AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CLEVELAND' 
  AND (FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST < 200 OR FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST < 200);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Select Statement**: We select fare-related fields (FARE_ID, ONE_DIRECTION_COST, ROUND_TRIP_COST) from the FARE table.
2. **Joins**: We join the FARE table with the AIRPORT table twice, once for the departure airport (PITTSBURGH) and once for the arrival airport (CLEVELAND).
3. **Where Clause**: We filter results based on the airport names and check that the fare is under 200 dollars for either one-way or round-trip costs.

Make sure to replace 'PITTSBURGH' and 'CLEVELAND' in the `WHERE` clause with the correct airport names as they appear in your AIRPORT table. You might also want to verify if the airport codes are being correctly matched if there are any variations.

Raw LLM Response:
To fetch the flights from New York and Memphis to Las Vegas on Sunday, we need to look for flights originating from the corresponding airports and filter by the flight days that include Sunday. 

Below is an SQL query that accomplishes this. It assumes the mapping of airports to the cities (New York and Memphis) is available in the `CITY` and `AIRPORT` tables.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.FROM_AIRPORT,
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAYS_CODE = F.FLIGHT_DAYS
WHERE 
    (C1.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK' OR C1.CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS')
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'SUNDAY';
```

### Explanation:
1. We select relevant flight information from the `FLIGHT` table.
2. We join the `AIRPORT` table twice to determine the departure (`A1`) and arrival airports (`A2`).
3. The `CITY` table is joined to filter the departure cities (New York and Memphis) and the arrival city (Las Vegas).
4. We use a join with the `DAYS` table to filter flights that operate on Sundays.
5. The WHERE clause specifies that the departure airport must be from New York or Memphis, and the arrival must be Las Vegas, filtering for flights specifically on Sunday. 

Make sure to run the above SQL with the necessary table structures and data available in your database. Adjust column names or table structures if they differ in your actual schema.

To construct an SQL query that retrieves flight information for routes from New York to Las Vegas and from Memphis to Las Vegas specifically on Sundays, you can use the following SQL statement. This query will join the necessary tables and filter the data based on your criteria.

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    (A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK') AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LAS VEGAS'))
    OR
    (A1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'MEMPHIS') AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'LAS VEGAS'))
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Sunday';
```

### Breakdown of the Query:
1. **SELECT Statement**: We are selecting relevant flight information like flight number, departure and arrival times, departure and arrival airport names, airline code, time elapsed, and stops.

2. **FROM Clause**: The main table is `FLIGHT` aliased as `F`.

3. **JOINs**:
   - We join the `AIRPORT` table twice: once for the departure airport (`A1`) and once for the arrival airport (`A2`).
   - We also join the `DAYS` table to filter flights for specific days.

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - We check for two conditions in an `OR` statement:
     - The route from New York to Las Vegas.
     - The route from Memphis to Las Vegas.
   - Both conditions must include the `LAS VEGAS` airport as the destination.
   - We also ensure that the flights are on Sundays by checking the `DAY_NAME` from the `DAYS` table.

### Note:
- Make sure that the city and airport codes are correctly set so that the subqueries can accurately retrieve `CITY_CODE` and `AIRPORT_CODE` based on city and airport names.
- You may need to adjust the `CITY_CODE` and `AIRPORT_LOCATION` checks based on actual values in your database if they differ from what is shown here.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh on a Tuesday afternoon, you can use the following SQL query. This assumes you have information about airports and their corresponding city codes, valid flight details, and the flight schedule:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'Los Angeles' AND
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'Pittsburgh' AND
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%T%' AND -- 'T' for Tuesday
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12 AND -- Afternoon flights
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18; -- Before evening (6 PM)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Columns:** The query selects relevant flight details such as flight number, airline, departure/arrival airports, departure/arrival times, the number of stops, and elapsed time.
   
2. **Joining Tables:** 
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `AIRPORT` table twice (for departure and arrival).
   - The `CITY` table is used to match airport names to cities.

3. **Filtering Conditions:**
   - The query filters for the departure city as Los Angeles and the arrival city as Pittsburgh.
   - It uses `F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%T%'` to find flights available on Tuesdays.
   - An interval check for departure times is performed to ensure they fall within the afternoon.

### Note:
The actual time filtering may need adjustments based on how you handle time zones and specific formats in your database, so you may want to adapt it as necessary to your schema structure (for example, if `DEPARTURE_TIME` is stored as a different data type or format).

Question: los angeles to pittsburgh afternoon on monday
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 , AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias1 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 , AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 , CITY AS CITYalias0 , CITY AS CITYalias1 , DAYS AS DAYSalias0 , FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE AND AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "pittsburgh" AND CITYalias1.CITY_CODE = AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE AND CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "los angeles" AND DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "monday" AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN departure_time0 AND departure_time1 AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias1.AIRPORT_CODE AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE ;
Raw LLM Response:
To create an SQL query that retrieves flights from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh on a Monday afternoon, you'll need to join several tables based on the schema provided. Here's an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    F.STOPS,
    F.TIME_ELAPSED,
    F.MEAL_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON F.FLIGHT_DAYS = D.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Los Angeles'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Pittsburgh'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Monday'
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12  -- Assuming afternoon starts at 12 PM
    AND HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18;   -- Assuming afternoon ends at 6 PM
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns we want to retrieve, such as flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the names of the from and to airports.

2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates that we're selecting from the `FLIGHT` table.

3. **JOIN Clauses**: 
   - Join the `AIRPORT` table twice:
     - First to get the details of Los Angeles (using `FROM_AIRPORT`).
     - Second to get the details of Pittsburgh (using `TO_AIRPORT`).
   - Join with the `DAYS` table to filter flights available on specific days.

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filter results to flights departing from Los Angeles and arriving in Pittsburgh.
   - Only include flights on Monday.
   - Filter the departure times to only include those in the afternoon.

### Notes:
- The query assumes that the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` column indicates the city associated with the airport, which is derived from your context. Adjust this part based on the actual naming in your database if there's a discrepancy.
- The time conditions (`HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME)`) can also vary based on how time is stored. Adjust to match the data type (e.g., if time is stored as text, you might need to convert it).
- Ensure to check the specific SQL syntax for your database management system, as there might be slight differences.

Question: a flight from BALTIMORE to SAN FRANCISCO arriving between 1700 and 2000
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "BALTIMORE" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find flights from Baltimore to San Francisco arriving between 5:00 PM (1700) and 8:00 PM (2000), you'll need to join the relevant tables to filter the results based on the specified cities, airports, and arrival times. Below is an example of an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    FLIGHT.AIRLINE_FLIGHT,
    FLIGHT.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    FLIGHT.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT,
    FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT,
    AIRLINE.AIRLINE_NAME,
    AIRPORT.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    AIRPORT2.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME
FROM 
    FLIGHT
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT1 ON FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT = AIRPORT1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT AS AIRPORT2 ON FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT = AIRPORT2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRLINE ON FLIGHT.AIRLINE_CODE = AIRLINE.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE 
    AIRPORT1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BALTIMORE' 
    AND AIRPORT2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND FLIGHT.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '1700' AND '2000';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **SELECT Clause**: This selects various columns from the `FLIGHT`, `AIRLINE`, and `AIRPORT` tables that we want to display in the result.
- **FROM Clause**: Specifies the primary table (`FLIGHT`) we are querying from.
- **JOINs**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for departure airports and once for arrival airports) and the `AIRLINE` table to get the necessary details related to the flight and its origin and destination.
- **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results:
  - Ensures that the flight is from Baltimore to San Francisco.
  - Filters the arrival time to ensure it falls within the specified range (between 1700 and 2000).

### Note:
- Depending on how your arrival times are stored in the database (e.g., 24-hour format, datetime format), you may need to adjust the format of the `1700` and `2000` values accordingly.
- The airport names ("BALTIMORE" and "SAN FRANCISCO") in the `WHERE` clause should match exactly how they are stored in the `AIRPORT` table. If they are stored differently, you might need to adjust the names or include corresponding airport codes instead.
- Ensure to replace the joined table names and conditions if the structure of your database does not use the names provided in the schema description.

Question: how many NW flights leave WASHINGTON DC
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the number of Northwest (NW) flights that leave Washington D.C., you would need to execute a SQL query that joins the relevant tables: specifically, the `FLIGHT` table to identify flights and the `AIRPORT` table to filter for flights departing from airports located in Washington D.C.

Assuming the airports in Washington D.C. are known (such as Dulles International, Ronald Reagan Washington National, or any other), you'll also need to filter the `FLIGHT` records based on the `AIRLINE_CODE` for Northwest Airlines. The typical `AIRLINE_CODE` for Northwest Airlines is "NW".

Here’s a sample SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfNWFlights
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%WASHINGTON%'
  AND f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW';
```

### Explanation:
- `COUNT(*)` is used to count the number of records that match the criteria.
- We join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to access the airport details.
- We check if the airport location contains "WASHINGTON" (you can refine this based on actual values in your database).
- We filter flights to include only those where `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'NW'.

Make sure to adjust the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` condition according to your actual data, as it might vary based on how the records are entered.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfNWFlights
FROM FLIGHT f
JOIN AIRPORT a ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a.AIRPORT_LOCATION LIKE '%WASHINGTON%'

Question: how many flights does NW have leaving IAD
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( * ) FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "NW" AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "IAD" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out the number of flights that Northwest Airlines (abbreviated as NW) has leaving from Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), you can execute the following SQL query. This assumes the primary key naming conventions and relationships accurately reflect the structure of your database schema.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfFlights
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE AIRLINE_CODE = 'NW'
  AND FROM_AIRPORT = 'IAD';
```

### Explanation:
- `COUNT(*)` is used to count the total number of records that match the criteria.
- `FROM FLIGHT` specifies that the query operates on the `FLIGHT` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights where `AIRLINE_CODE` is 'NW' (for Northwest Airlines) and `FROM_AIRPORT` is 'IAD' (for Washington Dulles International Airport). 

Make sure to run this query in your SQL environment connected to the appropriate database.

Question: i would like a connecting flight from DALLAS to SAN FRANCISCO leaving after 400 o'clock
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SAN FRANCISCO" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DALLAS" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.CONNECTIONS > connections0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a connecting flight from Dallas to San Francisco that leaves after 4:00 AM, you can use the following SQL query. This query will join several tables to find the necessary information about flights, airports, and their schedules.

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS FIRST_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.AIRLINE_CODE AS FIRST_AIRLINE,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS FIRST_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS FIRST_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f1.TO_AIRPORT AS FIRST_ARRIVAL_AIRPORT,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS SECOND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.AIRLINE_CODE AS SECOND_AIRLINE,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS SECOND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS SECOND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.TO_AIRPORT AS SECOND_ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fs1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON fs1.STOP_AIRPORT = f2.FROM_AIRPORT 
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = fs2.FLIGHT_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'DALLAS' 
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND TIME_TO_SEC(f1.DEPARTURE_TIME) > TIME_TO_SEC('04:00:00')
ORDER BY 
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME, f2.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects flight information for a connecting flight from Dallas to San Francisco.
- It joins the `FLIGHT` table for both the first flight and the second flight (connecting flight).
- The `FLIGHT_STOP` table is also joined to manage stopover details.
- The condition ensures that the first flight leaves "DALLAS" and the second flight arrives in "SAN FRANCISCO".
- The `TIME_TO_SEC` function is used to compare the departure time against '04:00:00'.
- The output includes both the first flight and the connecting second flight details. 

Make sure to adapt the names of the `FROM_AIRPORT` and `TO_AIRPORT` to match the specific codes or names used in the `AIRPORT` table, as "DALLAS" and "SAN FRANCISCO" may not correspond directly to the airport codes used in your schema. You may also need to adjust for any specific format for times if your database doesn't support the function used in the query.

Raw LLM Response:
To show the first class and coach flights between JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) and Orlando, we need to retrieve details from the `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `AIRPORT` tables. This query will filter based on the departure and arrival airports and the booking class for first class and coach. 

Here’s an example SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    fb.BOOKING_CLASS,
    fb.CLASS_TYPE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_CODE = 'JFK' AND
    a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'ORL' AND
    (fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F' OR fb.BOOKING_CLASS = 'C')
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

In this query:

- We're selecting relevant details such as `FLIGHT_NUMBER`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, and `ARRIVAL_TIME`.
- We're joining `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, `FLIGHT_FARE`, `FARE`, and `FARE_BASIS` tables to access needed information.
- We're filtering for flights that depart from JFK and arrive at Orlando (using its airport code, which could be `MCO` for Orlando International or similar).
- We're specifically looking for bookings where the class is either First Class (`F`) or Coach Class (`C`).
- Finally, we order the results based on the `DEPARTURE_TIME` for better readability.

Make sure to adjust the `TO_AIRPORT` code properly to the correct airport code for Orlando, as it might differ (i.e., MCO not ORL).

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve information on first-class and coach flights from JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport) to Miami, we will need to join several tables based on the relationships between flights, airlines, and fares. We're particularly interested in filtering the results based on class of service.

Here’s an SQL query that shows first-class and coach flights from JFK to Miami:

```sql
SELECT
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    a.AIRLINE_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    fl.FARE_ID,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    cod.DESCRIPTION AS CLASS_DESCRIPTION
FROM
    FLIGHT f
JOIN
    AIRLINE a ON f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN
    FARE fare ON fare.FARE_ID = f.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    FLIGHT_FARE ff ON f.FLIGHT_ID = ff.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN
    FARE_BASIS fb ON fare.FARE_BASIS_CODE = fb.FARE_BASIS_CODE
JOIN
    CLASS_OF_SERVICE cod ON fb.BOOKING_CLASS = cod.BOOKING_CLASS
WHERE
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'JFK' AND
    f.TO_AIRPORT = 'MIA' AND
    (cod.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'First Class' OR cod.CLASS_DESCRIPTION = 'Coach')
ORDER BY
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The query starts by selecting important flight details, including the flight number, airline name, departure and arrival times, stops, fare details, and class description.
- We perform several `JOIN` operations:
  - **FLIGHT** to **AIRLINE** to get the airline's name.
  - **FLIGHT** to **FLIGHT_FARE** to connect flights with their fare details.
  - **FARE** to **FARE_BASIS** to retrieve the booking class.
  - **FARE_BASIS** to **CLASS_OF_SERVICE** to get the specific class of service description.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include flights from 'JFK' to 'MIA' and ensures that the class of service is either "First Class" or "Coach".
- Finally, the results are ordered by departure time for better readability.

Make sure to replace the airport codes and class descriptions with the appropriate values as per your database content if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the first-class and coach flights from JFK to Miami, you would first need to understand the relationship between the relevant tables. In this case, you're interested in several key tables: `FLIGHT`, `FARE`, `FARE_BASIS`, and `AIRPORT`.

Here's a possible SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DE_PARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE

    AND (fare_basis.BOOKING_CLASS = 'F' OR fare_basis.BOOKING_CLASS = 'Y')
ORDER BY 
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
- The query selects essential details about the flights designated as first class (`'F'` typically represents first class) and coach (`'Y'` typically represents economy class) from JFK to Miami (MIA).
- It uses INNER JOINs to connect flight data to fare data, airport details, and fare basis definitions.
- It filters results to only include flights departing from JFK to MIA with the specified booking classes.
- The results are ordered by departure time to present them in a chronological order. 

Remember, you may need to adjust the specific booking class codes (`'F'` for First Class and `'Y'` for Economy) depending on the actual codes used in your `FARE_BASIS` table.

Question: are meals ever served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if meals are ever served on flights, we can look for the relationship between the `FLIGHT` table and the `FOOD_SERVICE` table by checking the `MEAL_CODE`. Thus, we will join these two tables based on the `MEAL_CODE` in the `FLIGHT` table and the `FOOD_SERVICE` table.

The SQL query below checks if there are any flights with associated meal services.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT F.FLIGHT_ID, F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, FS.MEAL_CODE, FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE FS ON F.MEAL_CODE = FS.MEAL_CODE
WHERE F.MEAL_CODE IS NOT NULL;
```

This query retrieves distinct flight IDs, airline flight numbers, meal codes, and meal descriptions where meals are served. If the result set returns any rows, it indicates that meals are indeed served on some flights. If no rows are returned, then no meals are served on any flights.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT F.FLIGHT_ID, F.AIRLINE_FLIGHT, FS.MEAL_CODE, FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION

Question: are snacks served on FF
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FOOD_SERVICEalias0.COMPARTMENT , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE , FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_NUMBER FROM FOOD_SERVICE AS FOOD_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.MEAL_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "FF" ) ) AND FOOD_SERVICEalias0.MEAL_DESCRIPTION = "SNACK" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if snacks are served on flight services (represented by the `FLIGHT_FARE` or `FLIGHT` tables) by querying the provided database schema, you can refer to the `FOOD_SERVICE` table, which contains `MEAL_CODE` and `MEAL_DESCRIPTION`. The `FLIGHT` table utilizes the `MEAL_CODE` field.

You may want to check for certain meal codes that indicate snacks. Let's assume there's a specific `MEAL_CODE` for snacks; for instance, let's say 'S' represents snacks.

The SQL query to find out if snacks are served on flights would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE FS ON F.MEAL_CODE = FS.MEAL_CODE
WHERE FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%snack%';
```

This query fetches flight numbers and their respective airlines where the meal description contains "snack", indicating snacks are served. 

If your `FOOD_SERVICE` table contains various meal codes and descriptions, you might want to adjust the `%snack%` search term based on the actual meal descriptions used in your data.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN FOOD_SERVICE FS ON F.MEAL_CODE = FS.MEAL_CODE
WHERE FS.MEAL_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%snack%';

Raw LLM Response:
To find the least expensive fare from Boston to Salt Lake City, you need to follow these steps:

1. Locate the airport codes for Boston and Salt Lake City.
2. Join the appropriate tables to find fares that match your criteria.
3. Retrieve the least expensive fare based on the connections between the tables.

Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Least_Expensive_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
  AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- The `FARE` table is the main source for fare information.
- We join the `FARE` table with `AIRPORT` twice (once for the departure airport and once for the destination airport).
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to ensure the departure airport is Boston and the destination airport is Salt Lake City.
- Finally, `MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST)` selects the minimum cost from the filtered results.

Make sure to check that the actual airport names in the database match "BOSTON" and "SALT LAKE CITY", as they may differ depending on how they are recorded in the `AIRPORT` table. If actual airport codes are available (like BOS for Boston and SLC for Salt Lake City), it would be better to use those codes to optimize the query.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Least_Expensive_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_NAME = 'BOSTON' 
  AND a_to.AIRPORT_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY';

Raw LLM Response:
To find the cheapest fare from Charlotte to Las Vegas, you'll need to join several tables in your database schema. Specifically, you will join the `FARE`, `AIRPORT`, and perhaps other relevant tables to filter the results based on the departure and destination airports, and then order by the cost.

Here is an example SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FARE_ID,
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    f.ROUND_TRIP_COST,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    fa.FARE_AIRLINE,
    fa.FARE_BASIS_CODE
FROM 
    FARE f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE' 
    AND a2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'LAS VEGAS'
ORDER BY 
    f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:
1. We select relevant columns from the `FARE` table and airport names from the `AIRPORT` table.
2. We join two instances of the `AIRPORT` table to find the corresponding airport codes for Charlotte and Las Vegas.
3. We filter the results to get fares where the departure airport is Charlotte and the destination airport is Las Vegas.
4. We order the results by the one-way cost (cheapest first).
5. We limit the output to just one result to get the cheapest fare.

Make sure that the airport names in your database exactly match 'CHARLOTTE' and 'LAS VEGAS' or adjust accordingly based on your data.

SELECT DISTINCT FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FARE AS FAREalias0 WHERE ( FAREalias0.FARE_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FARE_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias1 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias1.FLIGHT_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias1.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias2.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias2 WHERE ( CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias2.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias1.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias3.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias3.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias3 WHERE CITYalias3.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" ) ) ) ) ) AND FAREalias0.ONE_DIRECTION_COST = ( SELECT MIN( FAREalias1.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ) FROM FARE AS FAREalias1 WHERE FAREalias1.FARE_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID FROM FLIGHT_FARE AS FLIGHT_FAREalias0 WHERE FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WASHINGTON" AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE = "DC" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "SALT LAKE CITY" ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest fares from WASHINGTON to SALT LAKE CITY, we need to join several tables in our database schema to extract the relevant fare information pertaining to flights between these two locations. We'll also need to look at the airports associated with these cities to be able to match them correctly.

Assuming that "WASHINGTON" and "SALT LAKE CITY" relate to specific airport codes in the AIRPORT table, the following SQL query retrieves the lowest fares for flights departing from Washington to Salt Lake City:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    FARE.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FARE
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE FF ON FARE.FARE_ID = FF.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT F ON FF.FLIGHT_ID = F.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%WASHINGTON%' AND
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%SALT LAKE CITY%'
ORDER BY 
    FARE.ONE_DIRECTION_COST ASC -- You can also order by ROUND_TRIP_COST if needed
LIMIT 1; -- To get only the lowest fare
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Fields**: We select the flight number and airport names along with the one-way and round-trip costs from the fare table.
2. **Joins**:
   - **FARE** and **FLIGHT_FARE** to connect fare details with specific flights.
   - **FLIGHT** to get the details of each flight, including the departing and arriving airports.
   - **AIRPORT** to retrieve airport names based on airport codes.
3. **WHERE Clause**: Filters to get only the flights that depart from an airport associated with Washington and arrive at an airport related to Salt Lake City.
4. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the results based on the one-way fare (or round-trip if necessary) in ascending order to get the lowest fare first.
5. **LIMIT 1**: Limits the results to only the lowest fare entry.

Please adjust the exact LIKE conditions in the WHERE clause based on the actual naming conventions of airport entries for Washington and Salt Lake City in your database. Depending on how the airport names are defined (e.g. "Washington D.C." or specific airport identifiers like DCA, IAD), you may need to adjust the filters accordingly.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the lowest fare from Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI) to Salt Lake City, you'll need to join several tables to gather the necessary information: `FARE`, `FLIGHT`, and possibly `AIRPORT`. Below is an SQL query that retrieves the lowest fare from BWI to Salt Lake City using the relevant database schema.

```sql
SELECT MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST) AS Lowest_Fare
FROM FARE f
JOIN FLIGHT_FLIGHT ff ON f.FARE_ID = ff.FARE_ID
JOIN AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BWI' AND a_to.CITY_CODE = 'SALT LAKE CITY';
```

### Explanation:
- `FROM FARE f`: We're starting from the `FARE` table (aliased as `f`).
- `JOIN FLIGHT_FARE ff`: This connects the `FARE` table to the `FLIGHT_FARE` table, which links flights to their fare information.
- `JOIN AIRPORT a_from` and `JOIN AIRPORT a_to`: These joins link the fare to the `AIRPORT` table for both the departure (from) and destination (to) airports.
- `WHERE a_from.AIRPORT_CODE = 'BWI' AND a_to.CITY_CODE = 'SALT LAKE CITY'`: This condition filters for flights departing from BWI and going to Salt Lake City.
- `MIN(f.ONE_DIRECTION_COST)`: This part of the query retrieves the minimum fare from the results. 

### Note:
This query assumes certain column names and values based on the provided schema. Ensure that your actual data has the same values for airport codes and city codes as this query expects. Adjust the CITY_CODE for Salt Lake City if it differs from the actual code used in your database.

Question: list all flights leaving DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= departure_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all flights leaving Denver from the database schema provided, you will need to query the `FLIGHT` table. Since we want to filter for flights leaving from Denver, you must look up the appropriate airport code for Denver. Assuming the airport code for Denver International Airport (DEN) is used in the database, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
AND DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2000-01-01 00:00:00'
AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '2100-01-01 00:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT *:** This selects all columns from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **FROM FLIGHT:** This specifies the table from which the data will be retrieved.
- **WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN':** This filters the results to only include flights where the departure airport is Denver International Airport (DEN).
- **AND DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2000-01-01 00:00:00' AND DEPARTURE_TIME < '2100-01-01 00:00:00':** This adds a filter for the departure times, ensuring only flights between the years 2000 and 2100 are included. Note that the comparison assumes `DEPARTURE_TIME` is of a datetime type.

Make sure to replace 'DEN' with the actual airport code used in your database for Denver if it's different.
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT *
FROM FLIGHT
WHERE FROM_AIRPORT = 'DEN'
AND DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2000-01-01 00:00:00'

Raw LLM Response:
To find the airlines that serve Denver, you'll need to join the relevant tables in the database schema. The process involves using the `CITY`, `AIRPORT`, and `AIRPORT_SERVICE` tables.

The query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE a
JOIN AIRPORT_SERVICE asrv ON asrv.AIRPORT_CODE = (
    SELECT ap.AIRPORT_CODE
    FROM AIRPORT ap
    JOIN CITY c ON c.CITY_CODE = ap.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE c.CITY_NAME = 'Denver'
)
JOIN FLIGHT f ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = asrv.AIRPORT_CODE OR f.TO_AIRPORT = asrv.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE f.AIRLINE_CODE = a.AIRLINE_CODE;
```

In this query:

1. We select the distinct airline names from the `AIRLINE` table.
2. We join the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table to find services connected to airports.
3. We filter the airports to those located in Denver using a subquery.
4. We correlate this information with the `FLIGHT` table to determine which airlines operate flights from or to these airports.

Adjust the subquery to point to the correct airport code if there are multiple airports serving Denver.

Raw LLM Response:
To find the airlines that fly into Denver, you need to join the relevant tables from the database schema that contains information about airports and airlines. Specifically, you will need to look for the airline flights associated with the airport in Denver. 

Here’s the SQL query you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT A.AIRLINE_CODE, A.AIRLINE_NAME
FROM AIRLINE A
JOIN FLIGHT F ON A.AIRLINE_CODE = F.AIRLINE_CODE
JOIN AIRPORT AP ON F.TO_AIRPORT = AP.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE AP.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'Denver';
```

This query:
1. Selects distinct airline codes and names from the AIRLINE table.
2. Joins the FLIGHT table to connect airlines with their flights using `AIRLINE_CODE`.
3. Joins the AIRPORT table to find out which flights are landing in an airport located in Denver.
4. Filters the results where the `AIRPORT_LOCATION` matches 'Denver'. 

Make sure that the value for `AIRPORT_LOCATION` used in the query aligns with how it's stored in the database (i.e., case sensitivity, etc.). If you have the `AIRPORT_CODE` for Denver, you can directly filter with that as well for more accuracy.

Question: list all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list all of the DAILY flights arriving in Denver between the years 2000 and 2100, we will need to join multiple tables. The key tables involved would be `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `DATE_DAY`.

Assuming that the "from" airport is represented by the `FROM_AIRPORT` in the `FLIGHT` table and we need to find the relevant airport code for Denver from the `AIRPORT` table, here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    A.AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'DENVER%' 
    AND F.ARRIVAL_TIME BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2100-12-31'
    AND F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%D%'  -- Assuming D indicates daily flights
ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: We select relevant columns such as flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and flight days.
2. **FROM**: We are using the `FLIGHT` table as the main table.
3. **JOIN**: We join the `AIRPORT` table to retrieve the airport details. We check that the `TO_AIRPORT` column matches the Denver airport code.
4. **WHERE**: We filter for flights that arrive in Denver (case-insensitive matching with `%D%` assuming daily flights). The `ARRIVAL_TIME` is filtered to include only flights arriving between the years 2000 and 2100.
5. **ORDER BY**: We order the results by `ARRIVAL_TIME`.

Make sure to adjust the airport's name or the way of identifying Denver's airport (`AIRPORT_NAME LIKE 'DENVER%'`) based on actual airport codes or names stored in the `AIRPORT` table.

ORDER BY 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME;
```

### Notes:
1. The code 'DENVER' is used in the `WHERE` clause to filter for flights arriving at Denver. If the airport name or code is different, you should adjust that.
2. It assumes that `FLIGHT_DAYS` has a specific value indicating daily flights. If the representation of daily flights is different in your schema (e.g., perhaps using a specific code in a `DAYS` table), you might need to adjust that part of the query accordingly.
3. Make sure to confirm the actual data types and representations used in your database schema, as they might vary.

Question: show me all of the DAILY flights arriving in DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS = "DAILY" ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all the daily flights arriving in Denver between the years 2000 and 2100, we need to join the relevant tables and filter based on the required conditions. We'll assume that the airport code for Denver is "DEN" (you should verify this in the AIRPORT table if it is different).

Here’s how you can construct the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.CONNECTIONS,
    f.STOPS,
    f.FLIGHT_ID
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', d.DAY_NAME, '%') -- Assuming FLIGHT_DAYS contains the names of the days
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_CODE = 'DEN' 
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME >= '2000-01-01 00:00:00'
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '2101-01-01 00:00:00'
    AND d.DAY_NAME IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'); -- Assuming daily flights span all weeks
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting Columns**: We're selecting columns from the FLIGHT table to get the flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and other relevant information.
- **Joining Tables**: 
    - Join `FLIGHT` with `AIRPORT` to filter flights arriving at the Denver airport.
    - Join `FLIGHT` with `DATE_DAY` to ensure we check for daily flights (all days of the week).
- **Filtering**:
    - Filter on the airport code to get flights arriving at Denver (assumed to be 'DEN').
    - Filter arrival times to only include flights arriving from January 1, 2000, until December 31, 2100.
    - Make sure to get data for every day of the week.

Make sure that the syntax and logic fit your actual database schema and data types (e.g., checking the date formats). Adjust the specific filters and joins based on your actual requirements and available data.

Question: list all flights arriving or leaving DENVER between 2000 and 2100
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= arrival_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= arrival_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) OR ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME <= departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME >= departure_time1 ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "DENVER" ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve all flights arriving or leaving Denver between the years 2000 and 2100, you will need to join relevant tables to access flight information, airport information, and date information. Below is a SQL query that can be used to obtain this data.

Assuming `DENVER` refers to the Denver International Airport, we should first identify its `AIRPORT_CODE` from the `AIRPORT` table. Then, the query will join the necessary tables to get the flight details.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_ID,
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS DEPARTURE_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS ARRIVAL_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    (a1.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER' OR a2.AIRPORT_LOCATION = 'DENVER') 
    AND YEAR(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100
    OR YEAR(f.ARRIVAL_TIME) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2100;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: We select the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and the names of departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM Clause**: The `FLIGHT` table is the main table because it holds details about all flights.
3. **JOINs**: We join the `AIRPORT` table twice (with aliases `a1` and `a2`) to get both the departure and arrival airport information.
4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - We filter to check if the `FROM_AIRPORT` or `TO_AIRPORT` matches the `DENVER` airport.
   - We ensure that both departure and arrival times are checked for the specified year range (2000 to 2100) using the `YEAR` function. 

Please adjust the SQL `YEAR()` function based on your SQL dialect if needed (e.g., some SQL dialects may use different functions to extract the year). Additionally, make sure to check the accurate `AIRPORT_CODE` that corresponds with Denver's Denver International Airport code (which is usually `DEN`). If you already have the `AIRPORT_CODE`, you can directly filter using it in the `WHERE` clause for efficiency.

Question: what ground transportation is available from LGA airport into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the available ground transportation options from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to New York City, you can utilize the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which holds information about the ground transportation type and the respective airport codes. You would join it with the `CITY` table to ensure that you are filtering for the relevant city.

Here's the SQL query for that purpose:

```sql
SELECT G.TRANSPORT_TYPE, G.GROUND_FARE
FROM GROUND_SERVICE G
JOIN AIRPORT A ON G.AIRPORT_CODE = A.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN CITY C ON G.CITY_CODE = C.CITY_CODE
WHERE A.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' AND C.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

In this query:
- We select the `TRANSPORT_TYPE` and `GROUND_FARE` from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join the `GROUND_SERVICE` table with the `AIRPORT` table and `CITY` table based on their respective keys.
- We filter for the conditions that specify the airport code is 'LGA' and the city name is 'NEW YORK'. 

Make sure that the table and field names match exactly with your database schema.

Question: is there ground transportation from LGA into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is ground transportation from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to New York City, we can query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which contains information about ground transportation services available at various airports, along with the respective cities.

Here’s an SQL query to check for ground transportation services from LGA to New York:

```sql
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    gs.GROUND_FARE 
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs 
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON gs.AIRPORT_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE 
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_CODE = 'LGA' 
    AND c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

### Explanation:
- We are selecting the transport types and ground fares from the `GROUND_SERVICE` table.
- We join `GROUND_SERVICE` with the `AIRPORT` table to ensure we're looking at the right airport (LGA).
- We join with the `CITY` table to filter for services specifically related to New York City.
- The `WHERE` clause filters results to only include ground services from LGA to New York.

Question: please list the ground transportation from LGA into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "LGA" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To list the ground transportation services from LaGuardia Airport (LGA) into New York City, you will typically need to join the `GROUND_SERVICE`, `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, and `CITY` tables. The `GROUND_SERVICE` table contains the transportation types and associated fares, while the `AIRPORT_SERVICE` table provides information about the distance and direction from the airport to the city.

Here's an SQL query that could be used to achieve this:

```sql

    AND c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement:** This query selects the transport type and ground fare from the ground service records.
2. **FROM Clause:** The main table used is `GROUND_SERVICE` (aliased as `gs`).
3. **JOIN Clause:** 
   - It joins `AIRPORT_SERVICE` (aliased as `asrv`) on the airport code.
   - Then, it joins the `CITY` table (aliased as `c`) on the city code.
4. **WHERE Clause:** This filters the results to only include ground services from LaGuardia Airport (identified by the airport code 'LGA') going to the city of New York.

This SQL query will return all ground transportation options available from LaGuardia Airport to New York City. Please ensure that the actual city name in your database matches what's in the query, as there could be variations in naming or additional data that might need to be accounted for.

Question: please list ground transportation from EWR into NEW YORK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT GROUND_SERVICEalias0.TRANSPORT_TYPE FROM GROUND_SERVICE AS GROUND_SERVICEalias0 WHERE ( GROUND_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE = "EWR" ) AND GROUND_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve ground transportation options from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) into New York City, you will need to query the `GROUND_SERVICE` table, which connects city codes and airport codes with transport types and associated fares. You also need to link relevant airport and city information.

Assuming that the city code for New York City is available in the `CITY` table and that it is related to the relevant airport codes in `AIRPORT_SERVICE`, you might use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    gs.TRANSPORT_TYPE, 
    gs.GROUND_FARE, 
    a.AIRPORT_NAME AS AIRPORT_FROM,
    c.CITY_NAME AS CITY_TO
FROM 
    GROUND_SERVICE gs
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a ON gs.AIRPORT_CODE = a.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c ON gs.CITY_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
WHERE 
    a.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR' AND  -- Newark Liberty International Airport
    c.CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK';    -- New York City
```

Replace `'NEW YORK'` as appropriate if the city name needs to be checked against a specific variant, or ensure you have the correct city code mapping for New York City in the `CITY` table. This query selects all available transport types and their prices from EWR to New York City.
Extracted Predicted SQL:

Question: what are the nonstop flights from CINCINNATI to CHARLOTTE leaving after 1200 and arriving before 1900
SQL:

Standard SQL:

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve nonstop flights from Cincinnati to Charlotte that leave after 12:00 PM and arrive before 7:00 PM, you will need to join the relevant tables based on the flight details, airport codes, and specific time constraints. Below is the SQL query that achieves this:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_from ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a_from.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a_to ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a_to.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a_from.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI')
    AND a_to.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE')
    AND f.STOPS = 0  -- Nonstop flights have zero stops
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME > '12:00:00'  -- Flights leaving after 12:00 PM
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '19:00:00';  -- Flights arriving before 7:00 PM
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Selects the flight number, airline code, departure time, and arrival time along with the departure and arrival airports.
2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `FLIGHT` table as the main table for the query.
3. **JOINs**: Joins the `AIRPORT` table twice, once for the departure airport (Cincinnati) and once for the arrival airport (Charlotte).
4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights departing from Cincinnati and arriving in Charlotte using subqueries to get the corresponding `CITY_CODE`s.
   - Ensures that the flight is nonstop by checking that the `STOPS` field is `0`.
   - Enforces the time constraints for departure (after 12:00 PM) and arrival (before 7:00 PM).

Adjust any column names or logic if your database structure or requirements are different.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights based on your requirements, you'll need to join the relevant tables. The query will filter for flights leaving from San Diego to Indianapolis, on a Tuesday afternoon. This involves referencing the `CITY` and `FLIGHT` tables, as well as filtering by the departure day and time.

Assuming you have the relevant city codes for San Diego and Indianapolis, the SQL query would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_ID, 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
    F.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_FROM ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A_TO ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_FROM ON A_FROM.AIRPORT_CODE = C_FROM.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C_TO ON A_TO.AIRPORT_CODE = C_TO.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON FIND_IN_SET(D.DAYS_CODE, F.FLIGHT_DAYS) > 0
WHERE 
    C_FROM.CITY_NAME = 'SAN DIEGO' AND
    C_TO.CITY_NAME = 'INDIANAPOLIS' AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'TUESDAY' AND 
    HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) >= 12 AND 
    HOUR(F.DEPARTURE_TIME) < 18;  -- Afternoon (12:00 PM to 5:59 PM)
```

### Explanation:
- This query selects the flight ID, flight number, airline code, departure and arrival times, and the respective airport codes for both the departure and arrival locations.
- Joins are used to link `FLIGHT`, `AIRPORT`, and `CITY` tables together to filter based on city names for San Diego and Indianapolis.
- It fetches days of the week by filtering on a specific day (Tuesday) using the `DAYS` table.
- The `HOUR` function is used to ensure that the departure time is in the afternoon range from 12 PM to before 6 PM.

Make sure to adjust the `HOUR` clause based on your exact definition of "afternoon" if needed. Also, the method to check for days may vary based on how `FLIGHT_DAYS` is stored in your database.

SELECT DISTINCT AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM AIRCRAFT AS AIRCRAFTalias0 WHERE AIRCRAFTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE IN ( SELECT EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE FROM EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE AS EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0 WHERE EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCEalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias0.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( ( FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME = departure_time0 AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "BURBANK" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.AIRLINE_CODE = "AA" ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find out what type of aircraft is used for the AA flight leaving at 16:19, we will need to gather information from the `FLIGHT` table to find the specific flight, and then relate it to the `AIRCRAFT` table to get the details about the type of aircraft used. 

Here’s an SQL query to retrieve this information:

```sql
SELECT 
    A.AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION, 
    A.MANUFACTURER, 
    A.BASIC_TYPE 
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE ES ON F.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE = ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE
JOIN 
    AIRCRAFT A ON ES.AIRCRAFT_CODE = A.AIRCRAFT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA' 
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME = '16:19';
```

This SQL query performs the following steps:
1. Selects the `AIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION`, `MANUFACTURER`, and `BASIC_TYPE` from the `AIRCRAFT` table.
2. Joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `EQUIPMENT_SEQUENCE` table on `AIRCRAFT_CODE_SEQUENCE` to get the corresponding `AIRCRAFT_CODE`.
3. Further joins with the `AIRCRAFT` table using `AIRCRAFT_CODE` to access aircraft details.
4. Filters the results for flights that belong to airline 'AA' and have a departure time of 16:19. 

Make sure to adjust any specific column names or types if necessary based on your actual database schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Kansas City to Chicago leaving next Wednesday and returning the following day, you will need to join several tables from your schema. Assuming that Kansas City corresponds to a specific airport code (e.g., "MCI") and Chicago has multiple airports (e.g., "ORD" for O'Hare), you'll need to identify the airport codes for each city.

Here's a sample SQL query that does this, assuming you've identified the relevant airport codes and using a placeholder for the exact time and any necessary criteria for selecting the flight:

```sql
-- Find the airport codes for Kansas City and Chicago
WITH AirportCodes AS (
    SELECT
        KCA.AIRPORT_CODE AS KANSAS_CITY_CODE,
        CCA.AIRPORT_CODE AS CHICAGO_CODE
    FROM
        CITY KCA
    JOIN 
        AIRPORT KA ON KCA.CITY_CODE = KA.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN 
        CITY CCA ON CCA.CITY_NAME = 'Chicago'
    JOIN 
        AIRPORT CAA ON CCA.CITY_CODE = CAA.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE
        KCA.CITY_NAME = 'Kansas City'
)

SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AirportCodes AC ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AC.KANSAS_CITY_CODE AND F.TO_AIRPORT = AC.CHICAGO_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON DD.DAY_NUMBER = DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE) + 3 -- Assume 0 is Sunday
WHERE
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', DD.DAYS_CODE, '%') -- Filter for flights on the corresponding day (next Wednesday)
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- add your own time constraints if necessary
UNION ALL
-- For the return flight
SELECT
    F.FLIGHT_ID,
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    F.CONNECTIONS
FROM
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AirportCodes AC ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = AC.CHICAGO_CODE AND F.TO_AIRPORT = AC.KANSAS_CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY DD ON DD.DAY_NUMBER = DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE) + 4 -- The following day
WHERE
    F.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', DD.DAYS_CODE, '%') -- Filter for flights on the corresponding day (next Thursday)
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP; -- add your own time constraints if necessary
```

### Explanation:
1. **AirportCodes CTE**: A common table expression is created to determine the airport codes for Kansas City and Chicago.
2. **Flight Selection**:
   - A SELECT statement retrieves flight details for out-bound flights from Kansas City to Chicago on next Wednesday.
   - A UNION statement selects return flights from Chicago to Kansas City on the following day.
3. **Flight Days**: `FLIGHT_DAYS` is checked to ensure the flight is available on the specified days.
4. **Current Timestamp**: You may modify the departure time constraints as necessary according to your requirements.

Ensure you adjust airport codes and any specific filters you might need based on the actual data in your database.

Question: what are the flights on MONDAY that travel from CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA to PHOENIX ARIZONA
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_DAYS IN ( SELECT DAYSalias0.DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS AS DAYSalias0 WHERE DAYSalias0.DAY_NAME = "MONDAY" ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "PHOENIX" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias1.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias1 WHERE STATEalias1.STATE_NAME = "ARIZONA" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE ( CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CHARLOTTE" AND CITYalias0.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "NORTH CAROLINA" ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights on MONDAY from CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA to PHOENIX, ARIZONA, we will need to join multiple tables. Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = A1.AIRPORT_CODE 
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = A2.AIRPORT_CODE

WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'CHARLOTTE' 
    AND C1.STATE_CODE = 'NC'
    AND C2.CITY_NAME = 'PHOENIX' 
    AND C2.STATE_CODE = 'AZ'
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'MONDAY';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT F**: We select from the FLIGHT table where the basic flight information is stored.
2. **JOIN with AIRPORT A1 and A2**: This is to get the airport names we are interested in, mapping the departure and arrival airports appropriately.
3. **JOIN with CITY C1 and C2**: This ensures that we are getting the correct city names and state codes for CHARLOTTE and PHOENIX respectively.
4. **JOIN with DAYS D**: This filters the flights to only return those that operate on MONDAY.
5. **WHERE Clauses**: Here, we specify the conditions for the source city (Charlotte, NC) and destination city (Phoenix, AZ) along with the day of the week being MONDAY. 

Make sure to replace 'NC' and 'AZ' with the actual state codes used in your STATE table if they differ.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve the flights on Thursday leaving from St. Paul, Minnesota to St. Louis, you'll need to consider a few tables related to flights, cities, and days. The key steps include identifying the relevant airports for the cities, then filtering the flights based on the departure day.

Here is an SQL query that accomplishes that task:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c1 ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c1.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c2 ON a2.AIRPORT_CODE = c2.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DAYS d ON f.FLIGHT_DAYS = d.DAYS_CODE
WHERE 
    c1.CITY_NAME = 'ST. PAUL' 
    AND c1.STATE_CODE = 'MN'
    AND c2.CITY_NAME = 'ST. LOUIS'
    AND d.DAY_NAME = 'THURSDAY';
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selecting Relevant Columns**: The query selects the flight number, departure and arrival times, airport names for the departure and arrival, and the airline code.
  
2. **Joining Tables**:
   - It joins the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport names for both the departure (St. Paul) and arrival (St. Louis) airports.
   - It joins with the `CITY` table to ensure we are getting the correct cities associated with each airport.
   - Lastly, it joins with the `DAYS` table to filter for flights that take place on Thursday.

3. **Filtering Conditions**:
   - The city for the departure is filtered to be "ST. PAUL" in Minnesota (abbreviated as 'MN').
   - The city for arrival is filtered to be "ST. LOUIS".
   - The day of the week is filtered to ensure that it is Thursday.

Make sure to adjust the `STATE_CODE` for St. Paul as per your actual database records if it's represented differently.

    AND A_AIRPORT_S.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Charlotte') 
    AND D.DAY_NAME = 'Friday';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FROM Clause**: We select from the `FLIGHT` table which contains the core flight details.
2. **JOIN**: We join with the `AIRPORT` table to get details about the departure and arrival airports. 
3. **JOIN**: We also join `FLIGHT_FARE` and `FARE` for any fare-related details in case you need to incorporate that.
4. **JOIN**: The `DAYS` table is joined to filter the flights based on the day they operate.
5. **WHERE Clause**: We filter for flights departing from St. Louis to Charlotte on Friday.
   - The inner queries in the `WHERE` clause select city codes corresponding to St. Louis and Charlotte.

Make sure to replace `CITY_CODE` with the appropriate values if you need to verify or apply any conditions on the `CITY` table. Adjust the attribute selection as necessary based on the results you wish to show.

Raw LLM Response:
To query for flights from Salt Lake City (SLC) to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) that arrive on Saturday before 6 PM, you can use the following SQL statement. This assumes that the necessary data about the airports and their associated cities is correctly populated in your database. 

Here’s how you can structure the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT, 
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY C1 ON A1.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = C1.CITY_CODE AND A1.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_CODE)
JOIN 
    CITY C2 ON A2.AIRPORT_CODE = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE WHERE CITY_CODE = C2.CITY_CODE AND A2.AIRPORT_CODE = AIRPORT_CODE)
JOIN 
    DAYS D ON D.DAY_NAME = DATE_DAY.DAY_NAME
WHERE 
    C1.CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY'
AND 
    C2.CITY_NAME = 'NEWARK'
AND 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00'
AND 
    D.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday';
```

### Explanation
1. **Selecting Columns**: Select relevant columns like flight number, airline code, departure & arrival times, and airport names.

2. **Joining Tables**: 
    - Join the `FLIGHT` table with the `AIRPORT` table to link flights to their respective departure and arrival airports.
    - Join with the `CITY` table to filter flights based on the cities. The subqueries inside JOINs are used to link the appropriate airports with cities.
    - Join with the `DAYS` table to ensure that the flight arrives on a Saturday.

3. **Filtering Conditions**:
    - Filter for flights departing from Salt Lake City and arriving at Newark.
    - Check the arrival time is before 6 PM (18:00).
    - Enforce that the flight arrives on Saturday.

### Note
- Make sure the `ARRIVAL_TIME` is in the correct format in your database (the query assumes it's in 'HH:MM:SS' format).
- Adjust the column names and logic as necessary based on your actual schema and data structure.
- It’s also possible that `DATE_DAY` may need to be properly linked or derived based on actual datetime functions if the database supports them for filtering by days. Adjust according to your database's capabilities.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve a flight from Cincinnati to EWR airport that arrives on Saturday before 18:00, you will need to join several tables in your database schema. Assuming that the city code for Cincinnati corresponds to a specific airport code (let's say "CVG" for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport), you can execute the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    CITY c ON a1.AIRPORT_CODE = c.CITY_CODE
JOIN 
    DATE_DAY d ON d.DAY_NAME = 'Saturday'
WHERE 
    c.CITY_NAME = 'CINCINNATI'
    AND a2.AIRPORT_CODE = 'EWR'
    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00'
    AND f.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE CONCAT('%', d.DAY_NAME, '%');
```

### Explanation of the query:

- **SELECT**: We're selecting relevant columns from the FLIGHT table.
- **FROM FLIGHT f**: We're querying the FLIGHT table with an alias of "f".
- **JOIN**: 
    - We're joining the AIRPORT table twice: 
      - once to find flights departing from Cincinnati (a1),
      - and once for flights arriving in EWR (a2).
    - Joining with the CITY table to filter for Cincinnati.
    - Joining with DATE_DAY to ensure it’s a Saturday.
- **WHERE** clauses:
    - We filter for flights departing from Cincinnati (assuming 'CINCINNATI' matches the city name).
    - We check if the arrival destination is EWR.
    - We filter for arrival time to be before 18:00.
    - Additionally, we verify that the flight operates on a Saturday.

Make sure to adjust the query if the city code for Cincinnati or other specifics are different in your schema.

Raw LLM Response:
To retrieve flights between Cincinnati and San Jose, California which leave after 18:00 (6:00 PM), you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes you have a table structure as defined in the database schema you provided. 

First, ensure that Cincinnati and San Jose, California are correctly mapped to their respective airport codes. For the sake of this example, let's assume the airport codes are "CVG" for Cincinnati/NKY International Airport and "SJC" for Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport.

Here's the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = 'CVG' 
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = 'SJC' 
    AND TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) > '18:00:00';
```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **SELECT Clause**: Specifies the columns you wish to retrieve, including flight number, airline code, departure time, arrival time, and airport information.
2. **FROM Clause**: Indicates the `FLIGHT` table as the source of the data.
3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters flights that depart from Cincinnati (`FROM_AIRPORT = 'CVG'`) and arrive at San Jose (`TO_AIRPORT = 'SJC'`).
   - Ensures the departure time is after 18:00 by using `TIME(f.DEPARTURE_TIME) > '18:00:00'`.

Make sure to adapt the airport codes as necessary according to your database. If you need to convert the `DEPARTURE_TIME` to a specific format or timezone, you might have to include additional logic based on your database system's capabilities.

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "SAN JOSE" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE ( CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "HOUSTON" AND CITYalias1.STATE_CODE IN ( SELECT STATEalias0.STATE_CODE FROM STATE AS STATEalias0 WHERE STATEalias0.STATE_NAME = "TEXAS" ) ) ) ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.STOPS = stops0 ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find nonstop flights between San Jose and Houston, you'll want to join several tables from your database schema to filter the flights based on the relevant information.

Here is an SQL query that will help you retrieve the nonstop flights from San Jose (SJC) to Houston (IAH or HOU):

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f.STOPS,
    f.TIME_ELAPSED
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'San Jose' AND STATE_CODE = 'CA') 
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'Houston' AND STATE_CODE = 'TX')
    AND f.STOPS = 0;
```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT** clause: This selects the relevant information about the flights including flight number, airline code, departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, number of stops, and elapsed time.
- **FROM** clause: The query selects data from the `FLIGHT` table.
- **JOIN** clauses: It joins the `AIRPORT` table twice (once for the departure airport and once for the arrival airport).
- **WHERE** conditions: 
    - It filters the departure airport to be from San Jose in California.
    - It filters the arrival airport to be Houston in Texas.
    - It ensures that the flight has zero stops (`f.STOPS = 0`), indicating a nonstop flight.

You may need to ensure the correct airport codes (`SJC` for San Jose and either `IAH` or `HOU` for Houston) are used based on your data. Adjust the query if necessary depending on the exact names or codes available in your `AIRPORT` or `CITY` tables.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Salt Lake City to New York City next Saturday that arrives before 18:00, you would need to query several tables from the schema you've provided. Here's an SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
-- First, we will retrieve the CITY_CODE for Salt Lake City and New York City
WITH CityCodes AS (
    SELECT CITY_CODE 
    FROM CITY 
    WHERE CITY_NAME IN ('Salt Lake City', 'New York City')
),
-- Get the airports corresponding to the cities
AirportCodes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT a.AIRPORT_CODE 
    FROM AIRPORT a
    JOIN CityCodes cc ON a.AIRPORT_LOCATION = cc.CITY_CODE
),
-- Get the flights with the desired criteria: from Salt Lake City to New York City
AvailableFlights AS (
    SELECT 
        f.FLIGHT_ID,
        f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
        f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
        f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
        f.FROM_AIRPORT,
        f.TO_AIRPORT,
        a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
        a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME
    FROM 
        FLIGHT f
    JOIN AirportCodes ac1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = ac1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN AirportCodes ac2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = ac2.AIRPORT_CODE 
    JOIN AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
    JOIN AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
    WHERE 
        f.DEPARTURE_TIME >= (SELECT MIN(DATE_DAY) FROM DATE_DAY WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Saturday' AND YEAR = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) AND MONTH_NUMBER = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE))
        AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00:00'
)

SELECT * 
FROM AvailableFlights;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **CityCodes CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) retrieves the city codes for "Salt Lake City" and "New York City".
   
2. **AirportCodes CTE**: This finds the airports based on the city codes we retrieved in the previous CTE.

3. **AvailableFlights CTE**: This section joins the FLIGHT table with the airport codes to filter the flights that are departing from Salt Lake City and arriving at New York City. It also checks that the departure time is next Saturday and that the arrival time is before 18:00.

4. Finally, we select all details from the AvailableFlights CTE.

### Note:
1. The SQL environment may require adjustments based on your SQL dialect.
2. You may need to replace the selection of `MIN(DATE_DAY)` with actual date computation for the upcoming Saturday.
3. Ensure that the `ARRIVAL_TIME` and `DEPARTURE_TIME` formats match your SQL database's datetime format.

Raw LLM Response:
To list all Delta Airlines (assumed to use the airline code "DL") flights from Salt Lake City to New York for the upcoming Saturday and that arrive before 18:00, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    a1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT,
    a2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.FLIGHT_ID
FROM 
    FLIGHT f
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a1 ON f.FROM_AIRPORT = a1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT a2 ON f.TO_AIRPORT = a2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL' 
    AND a1.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'SALT LAKE CITY')
    AND a2.CITY_CODE = (SELECT CITY_CODE FROM CITY WHERE CITY_NAME = 'NEW YORK')
    AND DATE(DAY_NAME) = (SELECT DATE_DAY.YEAR, DATE_DAY.MONTH_NUMBER, DATE_DAY.DAY_NUMBER 
                           FROM DATE_DAY

    AND f.ARRIVAL_TIME < '18:00';
```

### Explanation:
- We select from the `FLIGHT` table and join it with the `AIRPORT` table to get the airport names for both departure and arrival.
- We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause:
  - We restrict results to those flown by Delta Airlines (`f.AIRLINE_CODE = 'DL'`).
  - We use a subquery to find the `CITY_CODE` for Salt Lake City and New York.
  - We select only the flights arriving before 18:00.
- Note: Depending on how the date is defined in your schema and how the days of the week are represented in your database, you may need to adjust the date selection part or add additional conditions.

Raw LLM Response:
To get a round trip flight from Kansas City to Chicago on Wednesday, May 26th, arriving at 19:00, you'll need to combine information from multiple tables in your database schema. Here’s how you can construct the SQL query:

1. First, you need to identify the relevant airport codes for both Kansas City (KCI) and Chicago (you might need to specify which Chicago airport, for example, O'Hare (ORD) or Midway (MDW)).
2. You also need to define the date details, specifically Wednesday, May 26th.
3. You must check flight details, including arrival times, to meet your criteria.
4. Finally, ensure to gather flight fare details for round trips.

Below is an illustrative SQL query based on the above logic. In the following example, I'm assuming the Kansas City airport code is 'KCI' and the Chicago airport code is 'ORD'. Please adjust these codes as necessary to fit your database:

```sql
-- Define the date you are looking for
SET @TARGET_DATE = '2023-05-26';

SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID, 
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID, 
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE AS ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE AS fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT AS f2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ORD' AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'KCI' 
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'KCI' 
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'ORD' 
    AND DATE(f1.DEPARTURE_TIME) = @TARGET_DATE
    AND TIME(f1.ARRIVAL_TIME) >= '19:00'
    AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME > f1.ARRIVAL_TIME -- Ensure return flight is after arrival
    AND DATE(f2.DEPARTURE_TIME) = @TARGET_DATE;
```

### Notes:
- Adjust the airport codes (`'KCI'` for Kansas City and `'ORD'` for Chicago) as per your actual airport code values in the database.
- The `@TARGET_DATE` variable needs to be defined in your SQL environment; in many environments, you may need to manually specify the date as '2023-05-26' directly in the query.
- The above SQL assumes the `ARRIVAL_TIME` and `DEPARTURE_TIME` are stored in a format that is comparable directly with the TIME function.
- If you have more precise requirements for the round trip (like specific return times), you could expand the query conditions further. Adjust the selection criteria according to your needs.

Raw LLM Response:
To find American Airlines (AA) flights from Newark to Nashville around 6:30 PM, you would typically query the `FLIGHT` table. However, you'll also want to filter by departure times and ensure the correct airports are represented, which might mean joining with other tables like `AIRPORT`. Below is the SQL query that should achieve this:

```sql
SELECT 
    F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
    F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
    F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
    A1.AIRPORT_NAME AS FROM_AIRPORT_NAME,
    A2.AIRPORT_NAME AS TO_AIRPORT_NAME,
    F.AIRLINE_CODE,
    F.CONNECTIONS,
    F.STOPS
FROM 
    FLIGHT F
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A1 ON F.FROM_AIRPORT = A1.AIRPORT_CODE
JOIN 
    AIRPORT A2 ON F.TO_AIRPORT = A2.AIRPORT_CODE
WHERE 
    F.AIRLINE_CODE = 'AA'
    AND A1.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NEWARK'
    AND A2.AIRPORT_NAME = 'NASHVILLE'
    AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '18:00:00' AND '19:00:00';
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the flight number, departure and arrival times, both airport names, airline code, connections, and stops.
2. **FROM Clause**: The primary table is `FLIGHT` (aliased as F).
3. **JOINs**: It's joining the `AIRPORT` table twice:
   - Once to get details for Newark (`A1`).
   - Once to get details for Nashville (`A2`).
4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - Filters for flights operated by American Airlines (AA).
   - Filters for flights specifically from Newark to Nashville.
   - The departure time is restricted to be around 6:30 PM (between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM).

You can adjust the time range as needed for better precision around 6:30 PM.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a round trip flight from Los Angeles to Tacoma, Washington with a stopover in San Francisco and a price not exceeding $300 on June 10, 1993, you would need to join several tables in your database schema to gather all the necessary information about flights, fares, and the specific constraints you mentioned.

Here’s a sample SQL query that could potentially satisfy the requirements:

```sql
SELECT 
    f1.FLIGHT_ID AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_ID,
    f1.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS OUTBOUND_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f1.DEPARTURE_TIME AS OUTBOUND_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f1.ARRIVAL_TIME AS OUTBOUND_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    f2.FLIGHT_ID AS RETURN_FLIGHT_ID,
    f2.FLIGHT_NUMBER AS RETURN_FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f2.DEPARTURE_TIME AS RETURN_DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f2.ARRIVAL_TIME AS RETURN_ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fare.ONE_DIRECTION_COST,
    fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST
FROM 
    FLIGHT f1
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = fs1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT f2 ON f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'TACOMA' AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'LOS ANGELES'
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP fs2 ON f2.FLIGHT_ID = fs2.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_FARE ff1 ON f1.FLIGHT_ID = ff1.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FARE fare ON ff1.FARE_ID = fare.FARE_ID
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'LOS ANGELES'
    AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND fs1.STOP_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'SAN FRANCISCO'
    AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'TACOMA'
    AND fare.ROUND_TRIP_COST <= 300
    AND f1.FLIGHT_DAYS LIKE '%S%'  -- Here we are assuming a place to determine if the flight is on the right day
    AND f1.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '1993-06-10 00:00:00' AND '1993-06-10 23:59:59'
    AND f2.DEPARTURE_TIME BETWEEN '1993-06-11 00:00:00' AND '1993-06-12 23:59:59'; -- Assuming return flight within one or two days
```

### Explanation of the SQL query:

1. **Selecting Columns**: We select relevant columns for identifying both outbound and return flights, including their flight IDs, numbers, and departure/arrival times.

2. **Joining Tables**: 
    - We join the `FLIGHT` table (`f1` for the outbound flight and `f2` for the return flight) based on the required airports.
    - The `FLIGHT_STOP` table is used to ensure that the outbound flight has a stop in San Francisco.
    - The `FLIGHT_FARE` table is joined to bring in fare information.

3. **Where Clause Conditions**: 
    - The departure dates and airports are specified. 
    - The fare conditions are set to ensure that the budget does not exceed $300.
    - The flight days condition checks the days of operation, although specifics may need adjusting per your actual data (here it's assuming day codes in the DB).

4. **Date Time Filtering**: The dated filtering ensures that the outbound flight is on June 10, 1993, and that a suitable return flight occurs shortly after.

### Important Note:
- You'll need to validate the actual day-of-week filtering based on the flight's schedule (the `%S%` placeholder assumes that the applicable flight days are stored in a relevant format).
- The actual names of airports should be replaced according to how they are referenced in your database. 

This query might require some adjustments, specifically regarding date handling, depending on how dates and times are stored in your database schema. Always test the query and adjust based on feedback from the database system.

Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Ontario to Westchester County with a stop in Chicago on May 17 that includes dinner, you'll need to join multiple tables in your database schema. Assuming `ONTARIO` and `WESTCHESTER COUNTY` are represented by their respective airport codes in the `AIRPORT` table, and you want to filter results that include a meal code for dinner from the `FOOD_SERVICE` table, here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    f.FLIGHT_NUMBER,
    f.AIRLINE_CODE,
    f.DEPARTURE_TIME,
    f.ARRIVAL_TIME,
    fs.MEAL_DESCRIPTION,
    f.FROM_AIRPORT,
    f.TO_AIRPORT,
    f.FLIGHT_ID
FROM 
    FLIGHT AS f
JOIN 
    FLIGHT_STOP AS fs ON f.FLIGHT_ID = fs.FLIGHT_ID
JOIN 
    FOOD_SERVICE AS food ON fs.MEAL_CODE = food.MEAL_CODE
WHERE 
    f.FROM_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'ONTARIO')
    AND f.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'WESTCHESTER COUNTY')
    AND fs.STOP_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT WHERE AIRPORT_NAME = 'CHICAGO')
    AND fs.STOP_DAYS = (SELECT DAYS_CODE FROM DAYS WHERE DAY_NAME = 'Thursday') -- Assuming May 17 falls on a Thursday
    AND food.MEAL_DESCRIPTION LIKE '%DINNER%'
    AND f.DEPARTURE_TIME::date = '2023-05-17'; -- Adjust the date accordingly
```

### Explanation:

1. **Table joins**:
   - The `FLIGHT` table is joined with the `FLIGHT_STOP` table to identify flights that have stops.
   - The `FOOD_SERVICE` table is joined to ensure that the meal description includes "DINNER".

2. **Where conditions**:
   - The query checks the departure airport is Ontario and the destination is Westchester County by querying the `AIRPORT` table for their codes.
   - It ensures that the stop is in Chicago.
   - Filters for flights that operate on May 17th.
   - The meal description contains "DINNER".

3. **Date handling**:
   - The date format and day checks need to fit into your intended query, so please adjust for the SQL dialect being used.

Make sure to adapt any specific airport codes or characteristics to meet the structure you have defined in your database.

Question: is there one airline that flies from BURBANK to MILWAUKEE milwaukee to ST. LOUIS and from ST. LOUIS to BURBANK
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE FROM AIRLINE AS AIRLINEalias0 WHERE ( ( AIRLINEalias0.AIRLINE_CODE IN ( SELECT FLIGHTalias1.AIRLINE_CODE FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias1 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias1.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias2.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias2.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias2 WHERE CITYalias2.CITY_NAME = "ST.

LOUIS" ) ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To determine if there is one airline that flies from Burbank to Milwaukee, from Milwaukee to St. Louis, and from St. Louis back to Burbank, you can use SQL queries to join the appropriate tables. You want to ensure you are checking for flights by the same airline in each leg of the trip.

The following SQL query checks for an airline that operates all three legs of the journey:

```sql
-- This SQL query checks for an airline that operates flights for all three legs of the journey
SELECT DISTINCT f1.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT f1
JOIN FLIGHT f2 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f2.AIRLINE_CODE -- Ensure it's the same airline
JOIN FLIGHT f3 ON f1.AIRLINE_CODE = f3.AIRLINE_CODE -- Ensure it's the same airline
WHERE 
    f1.FROM_AIRPORT = 'BURBANK' AND f1.TO_AIRPORT = 'MILWAUKEE' AND
    f2.FROM_AIRPORT = 'MILWAUKEE' AND f2.TO_AIRPORT = 'ST. LOUIS' AND
    f3.FROM_AIRPORT = 'ST. LOUIS' AND f3.TO_AIRPORT = 'BURBANK';
```

### Explanation:
1. **FLIGHT f1** is checking for flights from Burbank to Milwaukee.
2. **FLIGHT f2** is checking for flights from Milwaukee to St. Louis.
3. **FLIGHT f3** is checking for flights from St. Louis back to Burbank.
4. We join these tables on the `AIRLINE_CODE` to ensure they are all operated by the same airline.
5. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to list unique airlines that cover all three legs.

This SQL will return any airlines that operate all three specified flights. If there's a result, it means that at least one airline covers the entire route; if there are no results, then no such airline exists.

Question: i'd like to book two flights to WESTCHESTER COUNTY
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "WESTCHESTER COUNTY" ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To book two flights to Westchester County (which I assume is represented by an airport code), you'll first want to find the relevant airport code for Westchester County from the `AIRPORT` table. After that, you can look for available flights to that airport. Here's how you might structure your SQL queries step by step:

### 1. Find the Airport Code for Westchester County
```sql
SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
FROM AIRPORT
WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Westchester%';
```

### 2. Find Available Flights to Westchester County
Assuming you have a departure airport and possibly specific dates in mind, you can query the `FLIGHT` table. Here's a sample SQL query to find flights to the airport code you obtained above, say for a specific date:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_ID, F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, F.ARRIVAL_TIME, F.DEPARTURE_TIME, F.AIRLINE_CODE
FROM FLIGHT F
WHERE F.TO_AIRPORT = (SELECT AIRPORT_CODE
                      FROM AIRPORT
                      WHERE AIRPORT_NAME LIKE '%Westchester%')
  AND F.DEPARTURE_TIME >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;  -- Optionally, filter by departure time
```

### 3. Assuming You Found Two Flights
You would typically need to select two flights; once you have the available flights that meet your criteria, you can proceed to "book" them. However, booking would typically entail inserting records into a booking or reservation table, which isn't detailed in your schema.

Assuming that the booking process involves inserting a new reservation, you might use something like the following (you'll need the relevant data on passengers and any payment details):

```sql
INSERT INTO BOOKING (PASSENGER_NAME, FLIGHT_ID, BOOKING_DATE, PAYMENT_METHOD, TOTAL_COST)
VALUES ('[Passenger Name]', [Flight_ID_1], CURRENT_DATE, '[Payment Method]', [Total Cost]),
       ('[Passenger Name]', [Flight_ID_2], CURRENT_DATE, '[Payment Method]', [Total Cost]);
```

### Note:
This is a simplified overview. In a real application, your booking logic would also involve handling passenger details, seat selection, additional services, and possibly complex business rules related to fares and restrictions. Make sure to adapt the queries according to your needs and the actual table structure for bookings.

Question: find me a flight from CINCINNATI to any airport in the NEW YORK area
SQL:

Standard SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID FROM FLIGHT AS FLIGHTalias0 WHERE ( FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias0.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias0.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias0 WHERE CITYalias0.CITY_NAME = "CINCINNATI" ) ) AND FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT IN ( SELECT AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT AS AIRPORTalias0 WHERE AIRPORTalias0.AIRPORT_CODE IN ( SELECT AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.AIRPORT_CODE FROM AIRPORT_SERVICE AS AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1 WHERE AIRPORT_SERVICEalias1.CITY_CODE IN ( SELECT CITYalias1.CITY_CODE FROM CITY AS CITYalias1 WHERE CITYalias1.CITY_NAME = "NEW YORK" ) ) ) ) ;
Raw LLM Response:
To find a flight from Cincinnati to any airport in the New York area, we would first need to identify the relevant airports in the New York area. For this example, we'll consider three major airports typically associated with New York:

1. JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport)
2. LGA (LaGuardia Airport)
3. EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport)

Assuming the airport codes for these airports are as follows:

- JFK: "JFK"
- LGA: "LGA"
- EWR: "EWR"

We also need to assume that the city code for Cincinnati is something like "CVG" (Cincinnati/NKY International Airport). 

The SQL query to find flights from Cincinnati to any airport in the New York area would look like this:

```sql
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
       F.TO_AIRPORT, 
       A.AIRLINE_NAME, 
       F.TIME_ELAPSED 
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'CVG' 
AND F.TO_AIRPORT IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR');
```

This query selects the flight number, departure time, arrival time, from airport, to airport, airline name, and time elapsed from the `FLIGHT` table. It joins the `AIRLINE` table to get the airline name, filters for flights leaving from Cincinnati (CVG) and going to any of the identified New York area airports (JFK, LGA, or EWR).
Extracted Predicted SQL:
SELECT F.FLIGHT_NUMBER, 
       F.DEPARTURE_TIME, 
       F.ARRIVAL_TIME, 
       F.FROM_AIRPORT, 
       F.TO_AIRPORT, 
       A.AIRLINE_NAME, 
       F.TIME_ELAPSED 
FROM FLIGHT F
JOIN AIRLINE A ON F.AIRLINE_CODE = A.AIRLINE_CODE
WHERE F.FROM_AIRPORT = 'CVG' 
AND F.TO_AIRPORT IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR');
